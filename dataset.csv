2,Not Applicable,First lady Melania Trump has said little about what she intends to do with her prominent position  But in new court documents  her lawyers say that the multi year term during which she is one of the most photographed women in the world could mean millions of dollars for her personal brand  While the new documents do not specifically mention her term as first lady  the unusual statement about her expected profits drew swift condemnation from ethics watchdogs as inappropriate profiteering from her high profile position  which is typically centered on public service  The statement came Monday in a libel lawsuit the first lady re filed in a state trial court in Manhattan  Trump has been suing the corporation that publishes the Daily Mail website over a now retracted report that claimed she once worked as an escort  In the filing Monday  Trump lawyers argued that the report was not only false and libelous  but also damaged her ability to profit off her high profile and affected her business opportunities  Trump had the unique  once in a lifetime opportunity  as an extremely famous and well known person  as well as a former professional model  brand spokesperson and successful businesswoman  to launch a broad based commercial brand in multiple product categories  each of which could have garnered multi million dollar business relationships for a multi year term during which plaintiff is one of the most photographed women in the world  the lawsuit said  The products could have included apparel  accessories  jewelry  cosmetics  hair care and fragrance  among others  the suit says  The first lady is seeking compensatory and punitive damages of at least $150 million  Richard Painter  who advised former President George W  Bush on ethics  said the language in the lawsuit shows Melania Trump is engaging in an unprecedented  clear breach of rules about using her government position for private gain  This is a very serious situation where she says she intends to make a lot of money  That ought to be repudiated by the White House or investigated by Congress  Painter is part of a group of attorneys suing the president for an alleged violation of a constitutional clause that prohibits presidents from receiving foreign gifts or payments  In response to questions from The Associated Press  Charles Harder  Melania Trump attorney  said the first lady has no intention of using her position for profit and will not do so  It is not a possibility  Any statements to the contrary are being misinterpreted  Harder did not respond to a follow up question about what the lawsuit means by once in a lifetime opportunity  To Painter and others  there is no ambiguity  She is not talking about the future  Painter said  She is talking about earning money now  Scott Amey  general counsel of the Washington watchdog Project on Government Oversight  said it is another example of the first family blurring the line between public service and private business interests  Trump previously filed the lawsuit against Mail Media Inc  in Maryland  but a judge earlier this month ruled the case was filed in the wrong court  The lawsuit is now filed in New York  where the corporation has offices  Trump also had sued blogger Webster Tarpley for reporting the unsubstantiated rumors  Trump filed the lawsuit in Maryland after both Tarpley and the Daily Mail issued retractions  On Tuesday  Melania Trump attorneys said they'd settled the Maryland case against Tarpley  Mr  Tarpley has issued the attached retraction and apology to Mrs  Trump and her family  and agreed to pay her a substantial sum as a settlement  Harder office said in a statement  Melania Trump previous work in marketing has drawn scrutiny before  On Inauguration Day  the official White House biography for Melania Trump originally included an explicit reference to her jewelry collection  which it noted was sold on the home shopping channel QVC  By the next day  that bio had been edited and simplified to say that she had launched her own jewelry collection  A spokeswoman for the first lady said the website was updated out of an abundance of caution and that the jewelry line is no longer available in any case  President Donald Trump continues to financially benefit from his global business empire  breaking from past practice  Previous presidents and their families have divested from business interests and placed their holdings in a blind trust  although there is no legal requirement to do so  Trump handed daily management of the real estate  property management and licensing to his adult sons and a longtime Trump Organization employee ,0,0,1,0,0
3,Not Applicable,A House committee voted on Tuesday to eliminate an independent election commission charged with helping states improve their voting systems as President Donald Trump erroneously claims widespread voter fraud cost him the popular vote  The party line vote came less than two days after Trump vowed to set up a White House commission helmed by Vice President Mike Pence to pursue his accusations of election fraud  We are going to look at it very  very carefully  Trump said of voter fraud in an interview with Fox News that aired Sunday  It has to do with the registration  and when you look at the registration and you see dead people that have voted  Reports that Trump told congressional leaders in a meeting last month that 3 to 5 million ballots were cast illegally during the 2016 race were met with discomfort on Capitol Hill  While top Republicans have refused to disavow his charges of election fraud  they haven't pushed for action on the issue  which remains a low priority for congressional leadership  The vote in the House Administration Committee underscored  once again  the political differences between the Republican president and the party rank and file  The GOP majority on the committee eliminated the Election Assistance Commission  which was created by Congress after the 2000 Florida recount to upgrade voting technology and provide election related information to federal entities  state officials and election administrators  Republicans say the commission is a prime example of government waste  They've been introducing legislation to end the commission for years with little success  If we are looking at reducing the size of government this is a perfect example of something that can be eliminated  said Rep  Gregg Harper  the committee chairman  We do not need fluff  Harper said he hadn't spoken to Trump about the legislation  He is certainly welcome to call me at any time  he said  The bill was opposed by committee Democrats and voting rights groups  who argued that the federal agency plays a vital role in protecting elections from hacking and other types of interference  At a time when the vast majority of the country voting machines are outdated and in need of replacement  and after an election in which foreign criminals already tried to hack state voter registration systems  eliminating the EAC poses a risky and irresponsible threat to our election infrastructure  said Wendy Weiser  the democracy program director at the Brennan Center for Justice  The committee also voted to terminate the public financing system  which provides major party presidential nominees a lump sum grant of roughly $94 14 million in the general election  But by accepting the grant  a candidate may not raise any additional funds and is severely limited in how much of his own money he can give or lend to his campaign  President Barack Obama effectively ended the practice of candidates taking general election public financing in 2008  when he chose not to accept it  His Republican rival John McCain took the grant that year and was swamped by the Obama campaign spending  Neither Hillary Clinton nor Trump accepted public financing this year  Money for the public financing of campaigns is collected through voluntary $3 checkoffs on taxpayers' returns  The checkoffs do not affect how much money a taxpayer owes  The legislation would devote $63 million of the available funds to pediatric cancer research  The remainder would be returned to the Treasury for deficit reduction  It is not clear if the full House will vote on the measures ,0,0,1,0,0

On Saturday the Department of Justice  challenging Robart ruling  turned to the powerful 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to try to immediately lift the restraining order while the appeal was being considered  The appeals court denied the request  The outcome of today hearing with the 9th Circuit could determine  at least temporarily  the fate of thousands of refugees  immigrants and travelers in the United States and abroad hoping to enter the United States ,0,0,1,0,0

14,Not Applicable,In his first appearance before Congress as secretary of Homeland Security  John Kelly called President Trump executive order on immigration lawful and constitutional but said he should have delayed the order rollout just a bit so that members of Congress could be prepared  The thinking was to get it out quick so that potentially people that might be coming here to harm us would not take advantage of some period of time that they could jump on an airplane and get here  Kelly said  He argued that the order  which blocks travelers from seven Muslim majority nations from entering the country  will prevail [in court] and be able to take the steps necessary to protect our nation      Kelly repeatedly disputed that the executive order is a Muslim ban  insisting it is just a pause based on security concerns  He said five of the seven countries named in the order are nearly failed states and four of them do not have United States  embassies  So I am at a total loss to understand how we can vet people from various countries when in at least four of those countries we do not even have an embassies  he said  Earlier in the hearing  Rep  Bennie Thompson  D Miss   asked Kelly to provide information on any bad people who have been let into the United States  since a court halted the executive order  Let just say  for instance  a person who is trying to get to the United States to do some harm  some terrorist attack  is coming in during this period that the courts put a stay on our enforcement  We will not know that until an individual who is a bad person  until they do something bad  Kelly said  But it is entirely possible that someone that coming in  whether it is during this stay court action or previous to this  they intend to do us harm  But you do not have any proof at this point  Thompson followed up  Not until the boom  Kelly said  When asked to clarify  Kelly responded  Not until they act to blow something up or go into a mall and kill people  He continued  The vetting on the other end  in those seven countries  are suspect  And Mr  Trump  and certainly in my view  we have to do a pause  which he ordered  Now is under court action  so that we can take a look at what we are doing on the other end  I believe the vetting on the other end right now is not adequate to protect the nation  ABC News' Morgan Korn contributed to this report ,0,0,1,0,0

20,Not Applicable,The limited scope of DeVos' education policy experience has raised questions for many about whether she is suited to run the federal agency charged with making American public education first rate for all children  But there is another subterranean element to this debate  which now should be surfaced  especially given our racially charged environment and the role that segregated schools have long played in our politics  Racial animus was a primary catalyst of the move toward private and religious K 12 education almost 50 years ago  and racial segregation remains a dominant factor in all schooling  public and private  today  DeVos' track record suggests that as secretary  she will do little to combat these trends  In the wake of the 1954 Brown v  Board Supreme Court decision  which famously declared that separate schools for black and white children were not equal  the federal government began    albeit slowly    to desegregate  This applied to schools in the South that were previously forbidden by law from educating children of different races together and to schools in the North plagued by de facto segregation  The backlash  now infamous but perhaps too familiar even today  was fierce  From Alabama Governor George Wallace stance in the schoolhouse door and his proclamations of segregation now  segregation forever to Louise Day Hicks leading the Boston antibusing movement  the reaction to desegregation roiled American politics  But the Brown ruling did not apply to private schools  Thus  an estimated half million white students left public schools between 1964 and 1975 to enroll in schools that were known as segregation academies  This move to private schools was part of a larger white flight movement  White flight was one of the greatest demographic shifts in American history  Millions of whites nationwide moved out of cities and into racially isolated suburbs  Scholar Kevin Kruse has called white flight the most successful segregationist response to the moral demands of the civil rights movement and the legal authority of the courts  The character and quality of most American schools today  like the neighborhoods in which they are found and which they shape  have a racial past  Now  American public schools are falling back into a kind of racial segregation that is reminiscent of our country before Brown  In the last 25 years  the number of severely racially isolated schools  defined as those with 0 10% white students  has tripled  In 2010 in New York City  92% of black students and 88% of Latino students attended schools that were majority minority  some of which see such severely racialized and concentrated poverty that they are dubbed apartheid schools  In DeVos own state of Michigan  which has seen two decades of charter school growth  enrollment and funding for public schools has waned while schools have become increasingly segregated  Nor does public funding for private schools  which DeVos advocates  seem to achieve much good for students of color  Voucher and other public funding programs are marketed as appealing because tax dollars follow the child  But research over the past fifteen years shows that private schools are even more racially segregated than public schools  This has negative consequences for both white students and students of color  Research shows that both black children who attend desegregated schools end up with more income  higher wages and better long term health  with no negative effects on white students  Further  a range of studies strongly suggest that desegregated schools educate all children such that they can better contribute to American society and to a healthier American economy  It is therefore both a moral outrage and an economic mistake that so much of the current movement in favor of school choice and religious education carries the stain of racial animosity  even in dog whistle form  Of course  many private and religious schools are excellent and inclusive places of learning  But let not be fooled  School choice is not really about freedom  Freedom  of course  is a bedrock American value  But the kind of freedom associated with the flight away from integration and toward racial isolation will never lead to a more truly free United States  So as senators consider DeVos' nomination to oversee public education for every American child  they would do well to remember the deepest values of public schooling  as well as the deeper meaning of appointing a Secretary of Education associated with a more exclusive and racially exclusionary vision ,0,0,1,0,0

23,Not Applicable,After a combative round of telephone diplomacy with even the staunchest US allies  the commander in chief is planning a more genial approach this week when he decamps with Japan Prime Minister to his winter getaway in Florida for a round of golf  He is not likely to instruct Shinzo Abe how to dance the Cotton Eyed Joe  the way George W  Bush did when Vladimir Putin visited his Crawford  Texas  ranch  Nor is he hoping to replicate the courtside bro out Barack Obama enjoyed with David Cameron at a March Madness game in Ohio  But in bringing Abe to his ornate southern retreat Mar a Lago  Trump is nonetheless continuing a long tradition of presidents melding recreation and negotiation in their encounters with foreign leaders  Trump  who is still seeking his diplomatic footing three weeks into his term  finds himself more relaxed at his oceanfront oasis than in the White House  where he is lived for less than a month  He hopes the gesture will also put the buttoned up Abe at ease  That the one thing about golf    you get to know somebody better on a golf course than you will over lunch  Trump told a radio interviewer over the weekend  The President has told aides he hopes to use golf and visits to Mar a Lago as a way to develop warmer ties with his foreign counterparts  many of whom are approaching his presidency with uncertainty  Trump  who prefers to sleep in his own bed  has expressed little interest so far in traveling abroad  though he is committed to attending a European NATO summit in May and accepted an invitation from Britain Queen Elizabeth II for a state visit this summer  RELATED: Theresa May in trouble over Trump UK state visit invite At Mar a Lago  Trump is happy to play host  Overlooking the Atlantic on Florida Gold Coast  the club is firmly Trump turf  On his first trip there as president last weekend  he mingled in the club living room with paying members even as a Washington state judge halted his controversial immigration order  Friends say Trump is most relaxed in the confines of his estate    or playing golf on the courses he owns nearby  He is able to relax on the golf course with people he knows and trusts and likes  said Robin Bernstein  one of Mar a Lago original members  who speaks with Trump frequently when he is staying in Florida  I think that he finds golf kind of his outlet to relax  He loves it  he enjoys it  he is a fabulous athlete  and that what he loves  Some people go fishing    Donald loves golf  In Abe  Trump finds a leader eager to foster a closer bond with the US  particularly given Trump tough criticism of the Trans Pacific Partnership trade agreement  which Japan was a partner in  and the costs of US security support provided to the East Asian nation  This is a testament to the importance the United States places on the bilateral relationship and the strength of our alliance and the deep economic ties between the United States and Japan  White House press secretary Sean Spicer said on Tuesday after detailing the weekend trip  Abe enjoyed a congenial working relationship with Obama  but the two men never developed warm personal ties  When Abe tried bringing Obama to Tokyo best sushi restaurant in 2014  the US president grew restless as the dinner stretched for hours  Abe is hoping to start fresh with Trump  already meeting once with the real estate mogul in November  The pair discussed bilateral ties in Trump Louis XIV style livingroom at Trump Tower in Manhattan  Abe brought along a gold colored golf driver as a gift  I know he loves the game  and we are going to have a lot of fun  Trump said in the radio interview this week  I'll just make sure he is my partner  Trump invitation for a weekend at his private club continues a well established practice of vacation diplomacy for US presidents  His predecessors have acted both as hosts for their foreign counterparts and as guests at vacation spots and golf courses the world over  But no recent president has owned as lavish a getaway home as Trump  or been so eager to show it off  Obama  who maintained a residence in Chicago but rarely visited there himself  employed public properties instead to host foreign leaders away from the White House  Obama invited the new Chinese President Xi Jinping to the Sunnylands estate in Southern California for their first meeting  including a long ramble in scalding desert heat around the grounds  He used Camp David  the presidential retreat in Maryland Catoctin Mountains  to reassure Arab Gulf leaders of his Iran nuclear deal in 2015  Accustomed to more lavish environs  leaders like Saudi King Salman sent top advisers instead  More relaxing were his encounters with Cameron  After Obama flew him to Dayton for the NCAA tournament in 2012  Cameron reciprocated with a round of golf at the Grove Club in Hertfordshire  He was one of the few foreign leaders who joined Obama for golf    others included the Prime Ministers of New Zealand and Malaysia  Bush  who swore off golf shortly after the start of the Iraq War  hosted more than a dozen leaders among the scrub brush at his Crawford ranch  His three day summit there with Putin in 2001 featured line dancing and a barbecue  but little agreement on missile defense  A session with the Saudi King resulted in some awkward photos of the President holding the Gulf monarch hand  Bill Clinton used Camp David to try securing an agreement between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat at the end of his term  He was not successful; the wooded retreat proved less inspiring than it had 20 years earlier  when Jimmy Carter brokered a successful peace accord there between Israel and Egypt  Like Trump  Clinton identified golf as an entry point into personal relationships with counterparts  A round in 2000 with Singapore Prime Minister in Brunei started late and stretched well past midnight  American leaders aren't alone in using quieter retreats as a setting for talks  When Obama visited Saudi Arabia in 2014  then King Abdullah received him at his desert getaway oasis  Rawdat Khurayim  35 miles outside Riyadh  Trump  too  could soon find himself at another leader vacation home when he travels to Britain    though not necessarily to make him more comfortable  Alex Salmond  the former Scottish first minister  suggested this week that Trump visit to the United Kingdom may take place at Balmoral  the Queen Scotland estate  to evade the expected masses of protesters in London  The palace later tamped down that speculation  noting the Aberdeenshire castle was privately owned by the royal family  and thus unsuitable for a state visit  But of the Queen other official residences  two    Windsor Castle  outside London  and Holyroodhouse  in Edinburgh    would at least move Trump away from the capital ,0,0,1,0,0

25,Not Applicable,The lawsuit  brought by attorneys general of Washington and Minnesota  has captivated the nation since last Friday when a federal district court judge put a stop to Trump executive order restricting travel for foreign nationals  and as a result  temporarily opened US borders to immigrants once again  The hearing will be by telephone and livestreamed; here what to listen for: What is the hearing about  US District Court Judge James Robart upended Trump executive order nationwide Friday by temporarily halting the key provisions restricting travel for foreign nationals from seven Muslim majority countries (Syria  Iran  Iraq  Yemen  Sudan  Somalia and Yemen) and refugee admissions  The central question for the appellate court is whether Robart abused his discretion by putting a temporary hold on the travel ban  No court has addressed the constitutionality of the executive order thus far  The players The attorney general of Washington state  Bob Ferguson  filed the case and was later joined by the attorney general of Minnesota  Lori Swanson  The suit is being defended by lawyers at the Civil Division of the Department of Justice in Washington  DC  The randomly assigned three judge panel includes Judge William C  Canby Jr  an appointee of President Jimmy Carter; Judge Michelle T  Friedland; who was appointed by President Barack Obama; and Judge Richard R  Clifton  an appointee of President George W  Bush  When is this hearing  The appellate court has set an hour long telephonic oral argument in the case for Tuesday at 6 p m  ET  It will be available for live streaming through the court website  Each side will get 30 minutes to make their case  What are the states saying  On Monday attorneys for the states that filed the lawsuit submitted their brief urging the appellate court to keep the travel ban suspension in place  The states say that the temporary restraining order should remain in place because the President had unleashed chaos by signing the order  They also argue that the government claim    that it would be irreparably harmed by keeping Robart temporary suspension order in place while the case proceeds to the merits    does not make any sense  To accept DOJ position  they argue  would mean that until the (Executive) Order was issued  Defendants were suffering some  unspecified  ongoing irreparable harm  That makes no sense     Preserving the status quo against sudden disruption is often in the interest of all parties  What is the Trump administration argument  The government submitted its own brief in response Monday evening  DOJ continues to emphasize that the states do not have the ability to sue in this case and a district court judge does not have the right to second guess the President national security judgment in the immigration context  But the government also raised a fallback argument in its latest court filing    suggesting if the appellate court is inclined to uphold the Seattle district court decision  then it must at least limit it to the class of people who have been previously admitted to the US    like someone traveling on a student visa  In the government view  aliens outside of the US who have never stepped foot on US soil have no constitutional right to enter the US  What happens next  The judges have a number of different options at their disposal to resolve this case  but it is unlikely that they would rule on whether the ban is constitutional (since that is not the question before them)    the central issue is whether the executive order should remain suspended for now  For example  the judges could dismiss DOJ request for a stay of Robart decision because  as the government acknowledges  temporary restraining orders are generally not appealable  or they could uphold his ruling    but under either scenario the suspension of the ban would remain in place while the case moves forward with further scheduled hearings  Alternatively  the appellate court could find Robart abused his discretion and overreached to include classes of people not protected under the Constitution (e g   aliens living abroad)    in which case the travel ban would go back into effect  After the three judge panel publishes its decision  the losing party has 14 days to file a petition for rehearing the case by the full appellate court (but is not required to do so in order to get the case in front of the Supreme Court)  Given the high stakes involved in this lawsuit  it is expected that whoever ultimately loses before the Ninth Circuit will most likely appeal to the Supreme Court  At the moment  there are only eight justices on the court  meaning if there is a 4 4 split then the Ninth Circuit is ruling will be the law of the land ,0,0,1,0,0

28,Not Applicable,And it is been this way for more than a century  But a new injectable gel that blocks sperm inside the body  preventing them from leaving while allowing seminal fluid to pass through  has proved effective in trials using monkeys  The researchers behind the product  known as Vasalgel  hope it could get trials in humans within a few years  What was important here was that this worked and was safe in animals similar to humans  said Elaine Lissner  executive director of the Parsemus Foundation  the medical research organization behind Vasalgel that is also leading the trials  A new study  published Tuesday  involved 16 male monkeys receiving injections of Vasalgel who were released into social outdoor housing with females  Any adverse effects  as well as their ability to impregnate females  was compared with a historical sample of monkeys that had received vasectomies  It was a simple efficacy study  Lissner said  meaning the researchers merely set out to see whether the gel was safe and worked to prevent pregnancy  The social groups were monitored for at least one breeding season  and the team reported in its paper that none of the females in the group conceived during that time  One monkey had the gel inserted incorrectly  and another developed a sperm granuloma  or lump of sperm  but the majority tolerated the gel and saw little inflammation  Lissner said  adding that rates of granuloma and inflammation are usually higher after a vasectomy  Lissner team is hoping to conduct clinical trials in humans next year and plans to stage further animal trials this year in preparation  But although the gel worked well in monkeys  it will not necessarily translate perfectly to humans  This is a bigger  longer task than we first anticipated  Lissner said  Stopping sperm in their tracks Administering Vasalgel inside a man  or a monkey  involves a polymer injected into the sperm carrying tubes between the testicles and penis  known as the vas deferens  to block sperm as they are released  The injection is given under anesthetic and mimics the effect of a vasectomy  but without the snip  It is a sticky gel that goes into (the tubes) and basically filters out sperm  Lissner said  A similar polymer called RISUG is being trialled in India and has proved effective in men  The new gel is injected in a location similar to that cut during a vasectomy and allows fluids through while blocking sperm  The backed up sperm are then reabsorbed by the body  A further benefit is that    unlike with a vasectomy    the gel is meant to disintegrate when a second solution is injected to break down the barrier and flush it out  This would make the process reversible  Reversibility was shown in trials on rabbits  but it was not tested in the new trial on monkeys  Recent trials on baboons also failed to reverse the effect  Successful reversibility will be the key to make this world changing  Lissner said  Invasive procedure A further factor likely to impact numbers using this method is that Vasalgel still involves minor surgery to pull out the sperm tubes and inject the gel  What is more  when sperm are reabsorbed into the body  there is a risk of an immune reaction  potentially leaving men less fertile after reversal    similar to vasectomy  though risks with the gel are lower  according to Lissner  Fifty percent of men after a vasectomy reversal remain infertile  said Dr  Ilpo Huhtaniemi  emeritus professor of reproductive endocrinology at Imperial College London  who was not involved in the new study  However  he points out that this does not prevent men from having children  as sperm can still be collected and used for in vitro fertilization  The latest evidence on monkeys has many hoping a new form of contraceptive may be on the horizon  but experts believe more evidence is first needed on its reversibility  In order for it to have a chance of replacing the traditional surgical method of vasectomy  the authors need to show that the procedure is reversible  and it is reassuring that apparently such studies are ongoing  said Allan Pacey  professor of andrology at the University of Sheffield who was also not involved in the new research  The idea of trying to replace the traditional method of vasectomy by inserting a gel into the tube which carries sperm from the testicles to the penis at ejaculation is not a new one  However  we haven't seen much progress in developing the idea in recent years  so this study is a useful step in the right direction  A male hormonal birth control injection was shown to prevent pregnancy in a 2016 study but was ended early due to side effects  Other approaches have involved strategies to control the production of sperm by targeting the hormone testosterone  but this had side effects of depression and weight gain  In 2015  Japanese scientists discovered a protein  calcineurin  found to be crucial in helping sperm swim and break through the membrane of a female egg in order to fertilize it  When the genes behind this protein were blocked during studies in mice  they became infertile  But Vasalgel is further along than the Japanese research and has not shown severe side effects in animals  Lissner is confident that her team gel will overcome the challenges  She sees value in providing birth control that does not interfere with hormones  Why manipulate the whole body when there is a small tube that all the sperm swim through  she asked  Huhtaniemi agrees that Vasalgel could be valuable in certain populations but feels that in terms of birth control for the masses  a less invasive option is needed  We need a pill  That the easiest to administer  he said  It is feasible  We just need to find the right target ,0,0,1,0,0

39,Not Applicable,There is art in science    the artistic precision of the scalpel  the cool aesthetics of the laboratory  and the intimate observations undertaken by scientists to discover new materials and microbes living unseen in the world  Bio art  an artistic genre that took hold in the 1980s  solidifies  extends and enriches this organic relationship  According to the artist and writer Frances Stracey  it represents: a crossover of art and the biological sciences  with living matter  such as genes  cells or animals  as its new media  Bio artists might use and incorporate imaging technologies within the artistic space; bringing living and dead matter into the gallery  They draw upon biology metaphors to imbue artwork with healing and wounding propensities  In BioCouture  for example  fashion  art  and biology are weaved together  blossoming new materials into existence  As author Suzanne Anker has noted  Donna Franklin and Gary Cass have invented dresses made from cellulose generated by bacteria from red wine  Suzanne Lee composes 'growing' textiles produced by sugar  tea and bacteria to fashion jackets and kimonos  Lee makes jackets out of cellulose produced by bacteria in baths of green tea and sugar  Bio art includes the skins and cells of celluloid and digital video  the membranes of sound  and the liquids and fluids of body parts and eyeballs  To take another example  in Christian B k The Xenotext  a chemical alphabet is used to translate poetry into sequences of DNA for subsequent implantation into the genome of a bacterium  When translated into a gene and then integrated into the cell  the poetry constitutes a set of instructions  all of which cause the organism to manufacture a viable  benign protein in response  Writes B k: I am  in effect  engineering a life form so that it becomes not only a durable archive for storing a poem  but also an operant machine for writing a poem  one that can persist on the planet until the sun itself explodes    Scientists and artists work together in what become teeming new spaces of co creation  Together  they often set Bio art within current debates and concerns about what constitutes life  what counts as a sentient being  and who gets to determine what lives are saved  exploited or destroyed  Bio art draws together the hopes and concerns of scientists and artists as we hurtle into an age where human life and everyday living seems to be undergoing radical and sometimes dangerous transformations  As author Sheel Patel suggests in relation to Bok work: If a living cell can be cultured to spit out and produce novel poetry  could we eventually live in a society where humans are no longer needed to produce new thoughts  and works of literature  Arts and disease In the interactive art science exhibition Morbis Artis: Diseases of the Arts  actual and metaphoric communicative diseases are employed to explore the often toxic relationship between human and non human life  The exhibition explores the thin doorway that exists between life and death in a vexing age of species and habitat destruction  and the increasingly permeable tissues of contemporary bodies  The discourses of science in particular train us to see and to look for disease in every location  Science microscopic and bio technological powers allow it to reach into every atom  Of course  dominant discourse also communes that some spaces  things  and objects are more diseased than others  We are taught to see disease in the homes of outsiders and the nests of insects  in the fabric of pariah nation states and the tissues of certain religions and philosophies  At the same time  new materialism and animal philosophy question the very parameters of what life is  where it can be found  and they turn the question of disease onto humankind  whose activities are seen to infect all that it touches and taints  There is a frightening collision  then  between the possibilities and limitations of human and non human life: caught as it were between nightmare and dream  Morbis Artis: Diseases of the Arts is composed of 11 artistic works  with each piece using a different media or art form to explore the chaos of the world it draws upon  Each artist imagines disease differently  and yet within the terror of their imaginings there is great beauty  and much hope  In Drew Berry video projection  infectious cells are set free so that the very connective tissue of the exhibition room teems with the droplets of life and death  Herpes  influenza  HIV  polio and smallpox bacteria are projected onto the gallery wall as if they have taken flight  Magnified and chaotic  those entering the space are hit by their scale and size  Lienors Torre multimedia and glass work on degenerative vision explores how our view of the world is metered and tainted by digital technologies  We see two large glass eyeballs  a liquid animation  and a glass cabinet full of jars filled with water in varying degrees of opacity  with engraved eye images on them  Eyes quickly become raindrops as the liquidity of vision is brought to watery life  There are tears and scars that reflect across the eyes of this exquisite art piece  In Alison Bennett touch based screen work  the viewer is presented with a high resolution scan of bruised skin  Viewers can use the touch screen to manipulate the soft and damaged tissue before them  and their eyes become organs of touch  What does it feel like to touch a bruise and be bruised  The gallery is thus  both laboratory and studio  In all its variant forms  and with a scalpel and a paintbrush to hand  Bio art fashions the world anew  Morbis Artis: Diseases of the Arts is currently exhibited at the RMIT Gallery until February 18  2017 ,0,0,1,0,0

42,Not Applicable,But nature is not always kind  Fifty percent of the world lion population lives in East Africa    and lions like to eat livestock  Historically the Maasai would use deadly force to protect their herds  often heading out in revenge parties to hunt and kill lions  There were ritual killings also  known as Ala mayo  Killing a lion  a symbol of strength and power  was a rite of passage for Maasai initiates into Morani  the warrior class  Armed with a spear  these youths became men in the process  returning to the tribe to be treated with new found respect  The Tanzanian government banned ritual killing in the 1970s  but certain pockets of activity were silently condoned  In Ngorongoro Crater  north west of Tarangire National Park and a conservation area since 1959  the practice was judged sustainable due to the high lion concentration and low human presence  In the 1960s the tribe claimed no more than 10 animals per year  but as with so much of the world in the 20th century  the Maasai population grew in Ngorongoro  Forty lions  if not more  are now under threat annually in the conservation area  and all over Tanzania lion numbers are declining  Conservationists know the problem needs to be addressed  and in a remarkable turnaround they've enlisted the very best gamekeepers to patrol the Maasai Steppe: the Maasai themselves  At around 5am the Maasai Wildlife Warriors rise to birdsong  nature alarm clock  A bowl of porridge and cup of chai to start the day  Slipping on a pair of sandals  their soles recycled from old car tires  the Warriors head out of their kraal  a small sheltered community  to begin tracking  These Maasai have traded in their hunting ways for a life of conservation  Part of an initiative run by the Tanzania People and Wildlife Fund  an organization specializing in human animal conflict  the Warriors are spread across communities in Tarangire and the surrounding rangeland  using their skills  their lifeblood  to protect what was once their adversary  Beyond the boma  a low wall surrounding the kraal  tracks line the dirt  They betray the lions  hyenas and wild dogs who visit in the night  drawn to livestock and  in the dry season  the community water supply  On an uneventful day  Warriors might take a car owned by the Fund and conduct an animal headcount  circling the Steppe in the early morning  But sometimes tracks start inside the boma  suggesting a big cat  When big cat footprints are involved  they usually lead to a kill  The next step is crucial  People are becoming more and more angry towards wildlife  says Wildlife Warrior Lucas Lengoje  In the past a carcass resulted in retribution  The head of cattle per person has decreased among the Maasai in recent years  meaning the pain of every loss is felt all the more  The community finds it very difficult to comprehend the importance of the wildlife  Lengoje adds  It takes time to calm them down and for them to believe you  as they care more about their livestock than wildlife  Some of the reprisals have become extreme  Aside from spearings  Maasai have begun poisoning carcasses between a lion initial gorge and second feed  This not only kills the lion  but anything that feeds on the lion subsequent carcass  Wildlife Warriors intercede  dissipate the situation  and ultimately provide solutions for their communities and those around them  One of their primary concerns is to document the attack and location  using GPS to map the incident on the Fund database  They'll also warn neighboring herders of the dangers nearby  and sometimes provide contact details so Maasai can claim compensation from the government  Then begins the long term approach to preventing cattle loss  Living Walls (African myrrh trees joined by chain link fences) are being used by the Fund and built in collaboration with the Maasai  and have been rolled out across communities  The difference between the 'boma' and the Living Wall is that the living wall uses chain link  explains Elvis Kisimir  from the Fund  'Bomas' contain dried twigs from the thorny acacia bush  but chain link is infinitely more effective  especially when fortified with living  fast growing thorny trees  which only become more impassable with age  In the wet season these walls reach over 12 feet high  We currently have more than 700 'bomas ' and the Living Wall is a program that has safeguarded 99% of our livestock at night  says Kisimir  This immediate success is being supplemented with education programs fronted by Maasai Wildlife Warriors  aimed at neutralizing any antagonism between man and his fellow predators  If we decided to do this on our own  we wouldn't achieve much  admits Kisimir  Community is everything  Laly Lichtenfeld  executive director of the Fund  describes this as the next step  and a way to help create a self regulating environment in which both Maasai and lions can prosper  The Maasai people are absolutely critically integral to the conservation process in northern Tanzania  she adds  This is their land  and their livelihoods are so dependent on wise environmental stewardship  Healthy grasslands mean healthy livestock  And the livestock  the cattle  are core of their being    who they are  It is their pride  it is their identity; it is their economic wellbeing  And so if they can manage to really keep these ecosystems intact and healthy  then everything in the system benefits ,0,0,1,0,0
43,Not Applicable,But when you are the Dalai Lama  the deepest lines on your 81 year old skin are laugh lines  His Holiness knows how to find joy in nearly everything and everyone  largely because of his sense of humor  It is something he uses regularly to quickly win over crowds and something he thinks everyone should embrace in order to have a better life  When he presided over the Emory Tibet Symposium in December at an imposing temple owned by the Tibetan community in exile in Mundgod  India  he showed his teasing nature right away  Gathered were thousands of saffron robed nuns and monks  world renowned scientists  Tibetans and many interested followers  eager learn how to bridge science and Buddhism for mutual enrichment  The crowd looked as serious as the topic  As they waited in the temple  they murmured quietly and shifted in their seats  Finally  the low moan of a guttural chant began  and everyone quieted and sat up a little straighter  When His Holiness finally emerged from a side door  the sound of scraping plastic chairs echoed throughout the hall as the crowd stood and applauded  Some prostrated themselves on the ground  His Holiness walked in slowly  surrounded by monks in traditional robes and bodyguards in Western dress  Two monks gently guided him down a small set of steps  At the bottom  the Dalai Lama smiled with great joy  laughing and waving at the friends gathered in his honor  When you smile  I notice everyone around you smiles  I notice it is very contagious as well  said Dr  Sanjay Gupta  CNN Chief Medical correspondent  in an interview with His Holiness after the event  Basically  we are social animal  the Dalai Lama replied  We need friend  In order to develop genuine friendship  trust is very important  For trust  if you show them genuine sort of respect  genuine love  then trust come  so here I think the expression of genuine warm feeling smile I think part of that  that genuine smile  But it is clear that joking around is also key to winning over a crowd  At the event  the Dalai Lama finally sat in his floral chair  against what looked like a pillow one of the monks must have grabbed from his bed  hoping to make him more comfortable  The crowd quieted  leaning forward to hear what His Holiness had to say  But instead of a prayer or a gentle word of wisdom  he decided it was the perfect time to wipe his brow  He took his time and then  rather than putting the white washcloth on the table next to him  he immediately put it on his head  where it rested like an absurd floppy hat  Giggling  he wore it through first part of the meeting  for about an hour  Then  he reached with some ceremony for a glass jar of candy on the low table in front of him  This is not decoration  he joked  holding it up  He pointed to himself    eat    and promptly unwrapped the gold foil to pop a hard candy into his mouth  His impish behavior  laughing and joking did the trick  The solemn and respectful crowd began laughing with him  warming up immediately  Everyone seemed ready to listen to a discussion of heavy topics such as What are the fundamental constituents of the universe  and how did it originate  and How is knowledge established and what constitutes valid reasoning  When Gupta later asked His Holiness about why he decided to wear the washcloth so comically  the Dalai Lama admitted it was  in part  because he is practical and gets hot  But he also hinted that there was something deeper: It is important for leaders  particularly spiritual leaders  to act like a human being and to be playful  Often  everyone too much formal  he said  That is self torture  And though he knows he must respect those leaders  despite no word  no movement from them  he has sometimes developed a strange thinking and often hopes something unexpected will happen to make that leader act more like a human being  I had this experience (in) 1954 when I was in Peking  His Holiness said  Some Indian ambassador  he call on me  come to my room  then as usual  some Chinese foreign ministries officials come  Everyone too much formal like that  he said then mimed being stiff  Then somehow they brought some fruit  somehow dumped over  and then everyone acted like a human being  he said  laughing and miming people scrambling around  as he saw them do around on the floor  His Holiness suggests everyone let themselves be playful and find the funny in life  In his book My Spiritual Journey  he calls himself a professional laugher and writes that he comes from a cheerful family that is always amusing ourselves  teasing each other  joking  It is our habit  A quick laugh and an ability to see humor in daily situations and to be playful have been shown to help adults lower stress levels  both for themselves and for those around them  studies show  By being playful and using humor  people also become more observant and more empathetic  They are often bored less  they learn more  they have more friends  and studies show that people who are willing to let out their playful side tend to have a better sense of all around well being   His Holiness believes that no matter how difficult your life

45,Not Applicable,Now comes President Donald Trump claim Monday at the key US military base overseeing the war on ISIS    US Central Command in Tampa  Florida    that the media aren't reporting terrorism for reasons the President didn't elaborate upon  Trump told the CENTCOM audience  You've seen what happened in Paris and Nice  All over Europe  it is happening  It is gotten to a point where it is not even being reported  And in many cases  the very  very dishonest press does not want to report it  They have their reasons  and you understand that  To prove that the media aren't covering terrorism adequately the Trump White House  which is fighting in court to reinstate a refugee ban citing the terrorist threat  on Monday night released a list of 78 major terrorist attacks since September 2014  claiming  Most have not received the media attention they deserved  This is one of the biggest baloney sandwiches this White House has foisted on the public since     well     the Bowling Green massacre  but it is a much bigger and harder to swallow helping of baloney because it is the President who is forcing it down our throats rather than one of his aides  Taking the White House timeline of terrorist attacks  I ran it through the Nexis database  which is an authoritative resource for tracking media hits of all types  including in newspapers  magazines  wire service reports  TV news shows and the like  The results show that terrorist attacks over the past couple of years are  in fact  some of the most well reported stories of our times  The total number of media hits for the 78 terrorist attacks that the White House released Monday is 80 878  or about an average of slightly more than 1 000 mentions per incident  And those numbers clearly understate how much coverage the media have given these incidents because a Nexis search only will display a maximum of 3 000 mentions for any given search  There are 16 terrorist attacks on the White House list of purportedly under covered attacks that each elicited more than 3 000 media mentions  The following are a representative sample:  In Ottawa in October 2014 Michael Zehaf Bibeau killed a Canadian soldier   Two months later in Sydney  Man Haron Monis killed two Australians   In March 2015  21 tourists were killed at the Bardo Museum in Tunis  Tunisia   Two months later in Garland  Texas  two ISIS inspired militants attacked a Prophet Mohammed cartoon contest  Luckily no one was killed except the terrorists   In Tunisia  also in 2015  38 were killed at a beach popular with Westerners   In October 2015  224 were killed in Sinai  Egypt  when ISIS brought down a Russian passenger jet with a bomb  The terror attacks in Paris and Nice  France  that Trump cited in his CENTCOM speech also received more than 3 000 media mentions  The terrorist attacks that didn't get as much coverage were    surprise     the ones where there were no deaths or that took place in countries such as Saudi Arabia or Bangladesh where there is little independent media reporting  In three cases  there were no articles listed in the publications included in the Nexis database  and in each of those cases there were no casualties  The media  including CNN  have exhaustively covered terrorism around the globe since the 9/11 attacks made the issue a central national security concern  Indeed  the wall to wall media coverage of the ISIS attacks in Paris in November 2015 in which 129 were killed and the ISIS inspired attack in San Bernardino  California  a month later in which 14 were killed was instrumental in boosting Trump in the polls  according to the polling analysis site FiveThirtyEight Many Americans felt threatened by the ISIS directed and ISIS inspired attacks  As the presidential campaign was in full swing at the beginning of 2016  just over half of Americans said they were very or somewhat worried that they  or a member of their family  would be victims of a terrorist attack  This was the largest number to feel that way since just after the 9/11 attacks  And how did so many Americans learn about the terrorist attacks they were so scared of  Here a clue: It was not through telepathy  Below is the official White House timeline of terrorist attacks since September 2014 with my annotations in bold about the media coverage they each received  (There are a number of incorrectly spelled words I have left as they were in the original ) TIMELINE: September  2014   December  2016 NUMBER OF ATTACKS: 78 MELBOURNE  AUSTRALIA September  2014 TARGET: Two police officers wounded in knife attack ATTACKER: Abdul Numan Haider 406 stories TIZI OUZOU  ALGERIA September  2014 TARGET: One French citizen beheaded ATTACKER: Jund al Khilafah in Algeria 140 stories QUEBEC  CANADA October  2014 TARGET: One soldier killed and one wounded in vehicle attack ATTACKER: Martin Couture Rouleau 1 509 stories OTTAWA  CANADA October  2014 TARGET: One soldier killed at war memorial;

46,Not Applicable,Trump was defending the Russian President after Fox Bill O'Reilly called Putin a killer  His response  You think our country is so innocent  reveals Trump dismissive attitude toward the most fundamental democratic norms that America has aspired to embody  Clearly  the United States has made many grave mistakes throughout history  but the country guiding principles have remained unchanged: the fierce defense of individual liberties and an unshakeable commitment to democratic ideals  In Russia  by contrast  Putin has decimated the opposition  imprisoned critics and taken control of all branches of government  The free press is a faint shadow of its former self  and Putin critics  including journalists  continue to turn up dead under suspicious circumstances  One of Putin most vocal critics  Vladimir Kara Murza  remains in a Moscow hospital in grave condition after suffering a full organ failure that  as his lawyer told CNN  doctors agree is the result of a toxic substance  Despite Trump comments and recent executive actions  Trump should expect push back from a country committed to liberal democratic principles  This division between the President and the American people makes the United States the latest battleground in a worldwide clash of ideologies  When the wave of populist authoritarianism started  few would have expected the United States  the principal beacon of modern democracy for over 200 years  to fall under the spell of nativist politics  But fall it did  The many Americans who remain skeptical of Trump and now find themselves protesting on a weekly basis can take comfort in knowing they are not alone  On Sunday  while the American public was rapt in the Super Bowl  an astonishing sight came into focus in Romania  Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets to protest a government push to decriminalize corruption  The remarkable part was that protesters had already won  Demonstrations had begun six days earlier  after the government tried to quietly pass a decree that would have cleared the records and freed from prison people convicted of corruption for amounts less than $47 000  The government agreed to rescind the order  But the demonstrations only grew  with protesters saying they came out to protect their democracy  Romanians knew they had to fight for democracy because of their recent communist past and the onslaught in neighboring countries against liberal democracy  which requires separation of powers  a free judiciary  free and fair elections and  yes  freedom to protest  Sadly  now  in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and the surge of refugee arrivals  demagogic politicians have leveraged popular discontent  lashing out against foreigners  vowing to put their country true residents first  and gradually dismantling the foundations of liberal democracy  Romanians seem to have won round one  But the forces defending democracy elsewhere  including in neighboring Hungary  have been losing  Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban openly declared he is building an illiberal state  and is making strides in his quest to imitate regimes run by the likes of Putin  Democratic freedoms have suffered sharp reverses in recent years  Turkey is slipping into dictatorship  Venezuela remains mired in autocracy  as do countries in every continent  But what is ahead for the United States  Some veterans of the battle are pessimistic  When millions of mostly women took to the streets the day after Trump inauguration  Julia Ioffe  whose family fled Russia  threw cold water on their jubilant movement  tweeting  The happy  feisty crowds  the clever signs   it all feels like the protests in Moscow in 2011  That went nowhere  It is true that protests have not achieved much against other authoritarian regimes  In Venezuela  the Chavista regime came to power in 1999  and despite every effort from a determined opposition  it remains in power  In Turkey  mass demonstrations  and even what seemed like electoral victories  have failed to stop Recep Tayyip Erdogan march to de facto dictator  In Russia  Putin is all but unchallenged  with a quiescent legislature and near complete control of the news Russians consume  But the story is likely to have a different outcome in the United States  Yascha Mounk  a Harvard expert in right wing populism  observed that Trump is turning out to be more authoritarian than I feared  though the opposition is also proving more courageous than I expected  America has deeper democratic roots than any of the countries whose liberal democracies has been toppled  The national religion is freedom from tyranny  The day after Trump took office  Americans put on what may have been the largest national demonstration in the country history  A week later  when Trump issued his travel ban for seven Muslim majority countries  spontaneous demonstrations materialized at major airports across the country  Lawyers filed legal briefs on the spot  While the Republican controlled Congress has proven mostly silent in countering Trump attacks on the independent media and the judiciary  the press appears determined to do its job and judges seem unintimidated by White House bullying  Even members of the executive branch are speaking out  Many Americans support Trump  but there are signs that his sharp break with democratic traditions  his attacks on judges  his fulminations against the media and against critics of all stripes    from comedians to restaurant reviewers    are producing a backlash  History is being written by two opposing forces    those fighting for and those fighting against liberal democracy  President Trump likening of America to Putin Russia puts him on the illiberal side  But the American people have spent hundreds of years building a strong democratic system  and they are prepared to fight to defend it ,0,0,1,0,0
47,Not Applicable,Whataboutism was a favorite Kremlin propaganda technique during the Cold War  It aimed to portray the West as so morally flawed that its criticism of the Soviet empire was hypocritical  Any criticism of the Soviet Union (the war in Afghanistan  martial law in Poland  persecution of dissidents) was met with a list of Western abuses (supporting fascist dictatorships  trampling trade unions  racial oppression)  It was well encapsulated in a joke about the fictional Radio Yerevan (a staple of Soviet era humor) in which a caller asks what is the average wage of an American manual worker  The real answer would undermine Soviet claims to economic superiority  so after a pause  the pundit replies: Over there they lynch Negroes  By the time the system collapsed  that phrase had become a derisive synecdoche for Soviet propaganda as a whole  Whataboutism seemed to have died in the 1990s when Russia official aim was to become like the West  But it made a comeback under President Vladimir Putin  whose propaganda machine specializes in spreading FUD (Fear Uncertainty and Doubt) in the West  If Americans  Britons  Germans and others can be made to believe that their rulers are crooks and idiots  and that legality and liberty are a sham  then they will be much less likely to take risks and make sacrifices in defending their own countries  To some extent  whataboutism is a sensible tactic in argument  Criticism delivered from a purported moral high ground deserves special scrutiny  We shouldn't take lessons from Russia about minority rights  say  given the way that the Kremlin mistreats its own indigenous populations    Maris  Buryats  Komis and the like  But unlike Putin Russia  the West is genuinely well placed to make such criticisms  We are not perfect  But we are self critical and self correcting  The cornerstone of our system is contestability  Of course  our elected representatives and government officials make mistakes    but they are constrained and challenged for them  They risk civil and criminal legal actions  impeachment  media scrutiny  public protest and being tossed out of office into a lifetime of disgrace  These checks and balances are imperfect too  but they do work  President François Hollande has misruled France only mildly by Russian standards  But whereas he will not get a second term  President Putin can stay in office as long as he wants  President Trump has made an outrageous mistake in his visa ban and has immediately run into legal obstacles  When was the last time a Russian court told Putin that his actions were illegal  All this is lost on Trump  He appears to wish that America were more like Russia  He finds legal constraints on executive power outrageous  That view is not just mistaken: it is dangerous  All over the world  people look to America as a beacon of freedom and justice  It sets a standard (albeit sometimes a theoretical one) by which other political systems are judged  That represents a huge store of political capital  Trump is squandering it with every word he utters  Moral relativism corrodes sentiment in the frontline states of the new cold war  In places like Bulgaria  Georgia  Moldova and Ukraine  pro Western figures are feeling that their struggle is doomed  Why bother fighting for freedom when the leader of the free world has given up  Worse than this  the thinking will spread that maybe Putin is right: the world is all about power and money  and the political currency that really works is coined from lies and fear  If those are the real rules of the game  then better to play them  It seems to have worked for Trump  after all  Edward Lucas is a senior editor at The Economist  where he was the Moscow bureau chief from 1998 to 2002  He is also senior vice president at the Center for European Policy Analysis  a Washington  D C   think tank  The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own ,0,0,1,0,0
48,Not Applicable,Let hope these came in handy when he watched Melissa McCarthy parody the White House spokesman on Saturday Night Live over the weekend   We all know his thin skinned  humorless boss  President Donald Trump  has not taken kindly to SNL countless spoofs  complaining on Twitter that SNL is unwatchable  totally biased and not funny  He is also said that Alec Baldwin impersonation just can not get any worse  I happen to largely agree with that assessment  SNL has taken to merely mimicking Trump and his antics through Baldwin  rather than cleverly satirizing him  Despite plenty of material to work with  thus far  the Trump SNL era has been  well  boring and predictable   Until this weekend  that is  The difference between the usual Trump spoofs and McCarthy take on Spicer is that hers was actually hilarious   A podium wielding McCarthy plays on Spicer rocky start at the White House    his oratorical stumbles  his new  Trump like scorn for critical press  his equally Trumpian fact manipulation    with a well studied ear for his tics and tone   Exaggerating a White House spokesman might sound like inside the beltway kind of humor that average viewers will not appreciate or find funny  But in the theatrical  reality television era of Trump  everyone around him is a character  too  And in this case  SNL writers didn't just mimic Spicer  they encapsulated a far bigger story: this is what it looks like when a normal  professional political operative becomes Trumpified  And if you didn't laugh out loud  you may have Trump thin skin disorder  But will Spicer follow his boss lead  tweeting out how unfunny SNL is  or telling reporters that the show is biased and unwatchable  Not if he is smart  he will not   If an SNL spoof is funny  there is only one way for the spoofee to handle it    embrace it  At his next press briefing (Monday was called off)  where he will undoubtedly be asked about it  he should laugh it off  say he was flattered  and then make a joke at his own expense  He already took a crack at this approach in an interview with Extra on Sunday  telling AJ Calloway that McCarthy could dial back a bit  but also managing to call the show funny   If he can keep this up  he'd be following a long tradition of politicos taking parody in stride   In 1995  House Republicans invited Chris Farley  who'd been impersonating Speaker Newt Gingrich on SNL  to impersonate him to his face at the conference meeting while Gingrich laughed along   After spoofing George H W  Bush for four years  Dana Carvey was invited to the White House to meet him  After Bush lost to Bill Clinton  he had Carvey come cheer up his staff   In October of 2008  after Tina Fey spent weeks perfectly portraying then Alaska Governor Sarah Palin  Palin appeared on SNL alongside Fey and Alec Baldwin  who mistakes her for Fey    his former 30 Rock co star    and asks how she could appear on the show with the real Palin  that horrible woman   But that was all BT    Before Trump  I know dozens of people in his new administration and many have become more like him  at least outwardly  They've become defensive  self serious and aggressive  and they've adopted Trump rhetorical penchant for hyperbole  bombast and fact blurring  They say things publicly that I know they never would have said before  It seems like they are playing a part in a new Trump reality show  I wouldn't be surprised if Spicer reverts to Trump lack of humor toward unflattering satire  just to stick to script  But that would make it infinitely worse  It is already problematic that the credibility of the White House and its staff is being lampooned only two weeks into the job  With the elevation of Trump political adviser Steve Bannon  some are wondering who are the cooler heads and saner voices surrounding the president  If the White House wants to allay these fears    and perhaps they do not    Spicer should be his cooler  saner  pre Trump self  and play along with McCarthy performance  Otherwise  the notion that Trump White House can not take a joke gets a lot more serious ,0,0,1,0,0

pregnant woman  that is a long  long time  Yolanda says she is originally from Congo  She and her husband are among tens of thousands of migrants    many from Africa and Haiti    criss crossing South and Central America trying to reach the United States  Now they are stuck in the border town of Paso Canoas  Costa Rica  waiting for the travel documents that will let them enter the country and continue their journey northward   I hope to leave soon  for my turn to come fast so I can see a doctor  she says  I do not want my baby to be born on the road  Read: Deadly crossing into Europe Long an obligatory stop on an important trade and tourist route  Paso Canoas has seen an unprecedented influx of migrants trekking north in recent months   The huge surge in undocumented arrivals is a logistical and humanitarian nightmare for the government of Costa Rica   At this moment Costa Rica is absolutely overwhelmed with our immigration situation and we are doing our best to protect the human rights of the people who are coming  said Mauricio Herrera Ulloa  the Costa Rican Communications Minister and point person for the migration crisis   No one was prepared or was thinking about the possibility that we would receive 10 000 people from Haiti or Africa  Perilous journeys Since April  when Costa Rica first started issuing transit visas for undocumented migrants  more than 18 000 people have crossed the border into the country  There are no comparative figures because the demand simply was not there in previous years so the visas didn't exist  officials say   It is a situation that is being replicated in border towns throughout the Americas   Experts say migrants are risking their lives in perilous journeys that expose them to crime and hunger and leave them vulnerable to human trafficking  They offer (migrants) something that they really need and in the case of these people  what they really need is to get one more border north  says Cy Winter  director of border management for the International Organization for Migration (IOM)  More on human trafficking That means they often pay so called coyotes for illegal border crossings    breaking their ties to the state and public administration system  They often fall prey to false job offers just over the border   But then  on the other side  what is arranged there is completely different  says Winter  So they end up in a place where they have to work and they've got no way to get away from it  'Congo isn't a country  it is a password'  The IOM and other experts believe the majority of migrants are Haitians  many of them pretending to be Congolese in order to avoid deportation since it would be too costly for most Latin American countries to fly them to Africa  And in both Haiti and Congo  French is spoken   The people I've spoken to claiming to be from Congo  barely know the capital and do not know the dialects that are spoken in the Congo and do not know the football jersey  said Winter   According to the US Secretary of Homeland Security  some 40 000 Haitian migrants are working their way north  already overwhelming many border crossings into the United States   Many of them entered Brazil as legal refugees after the 2010 earthquake  But the economic crisis in Brazil has made it increasingly difficult for migrants to get jobs  sparking an exodus  We've seen accumulations of up to 5 000 people on the border in various countries in South America so it is a concerning uptick in arrivals  said Winter   One migrant I met on the Panamanian Costa Rican border told me that every single one of the dozens of Congolese migrants milling about the migration office was actually from Haiti   Here  Congo isn't a country  it is a password  he said  explaining that he and others destroy their passports so that they can re invent themselves   The bottlenecks at borders have raised serious concerns  The IOM has begun offering workshops at schools like Colegio Progreso    in Panama  just across the border from Paso Canoas    teaching students about the connection between migration and human trafficking   In the past  the school was used as a shelter for hundreds of Cubans trying to make their way to the United States  The regional school director says she heard stories of women turning to prostitution in desperation   In relation to the people being trafficked  we've heard horror stories  said Flor Bonilla   In San Jose  the capital of Costa Rica  Marilia Morales is just as worried  She founded the non profit Rahab Foundation 20 years ago to rescue  rehabilitate and support survivors of sexual exploitation  Now she is launching a project on Costa Rica northern border with Nicaragua   We have an avalanche of people coming  we have Africans  Haitians  we have people coming from a lot of places  Morales told CNN   We are in the process of training our personnel and we are going to be working with this community directly because they have to be aware that they could be victims of human trafficking  either for slave labor  sexual slavery and other ends  she said   Nicaragua has closed its borders to undocumented migrants forcing thousands on the border into deplorable makeshift shelters and tent villages   On Costa Rica southern border  officials are trying to process migrants as quickly as possible  They are admitting 100 200 a day  but there is a long waiting list  In Yolanda case  her hopes for a quick trip through Costa Rica were quickly dashed  Upon arrival  she was told she would have to wait six weeks just for an appointment with immigration officials   Without the laissez passer  she and her husband can not access the shelters set up by authorities in conjunction with the Red Cross    warehouses and schools where migrants get free meals and a mattress to sleep on   For the time being  they are sleeping in a makeshift hostel just a short walk from the border  They pay $5 a day and squeeze in with some 50 other people   Yolanda says she left Congo for Brazil  where she worked in a restaurant for a year  She says both she and her husband lost their jobs in the recession    just as they discovered she was pregnant  Now  their dream is for their daughter to be born in the United States   But the odds are not in their favor  The money they borrowed from family back home is running out and she says they can not ask for more   While Yolanda says she is from Congo  when I first met her  she couldn't at first remember or pronounce what she said was her hometown: Brazzaville  the capital of Congo   When the time came to say goodbye to Yolanda and her husband  I couldn't help but wonder where they came from  and where this journey will ultimately take them   Unfortunately for Haitians trying to make their way into the United States  officials recently eliminated the generous benefits and easy entry that were established after the 2010 earthquake   Which means that even if they make it to the US border after months of travel and hardship  neither Haitian nor Congolese migrants are likely to get in ,0,0,1,0,0

determined to shake the guilt and shame that she knows should stalk her perpetrators instead of her  Now I see that I was just a child  says Chopek  now sitting serenely in a safe house  a healing lodge in rural Manitoba that cradled her in the love and protection she so needed when she escaped her life on the streets  Now 19  Lauren was just 14 when she was sexually exploited and trafficked for sex in her hometown of Winnipeg  But as an indigenous girl in Canada  her story is hardly rare  More from the CNN Freedom Project Canada indigenous population is very small    just 4% of the population    yet more than 50% of all sex trafficking victims in Canada are indigenous  The reasons are complicated and varied but are ultimately rooted in a legacy of poverty  racism and abuse  I was actually making these bad choices for a reason  explains Chopek  You know when you experience sexual abuse it is really confusing  You never know if it is your fault or is it theirs  'Targets of violence and abuse' Diane Redsky runs Ma Mawi Wi Chi Itata Centre  which advocates for indigenous women and children  specifically sex trafficking victims  Her organization runs the rural healing lodge where Chopek stayed  as well as safe houses  rehabilitation and prevention programs throughout Manitoba  Read: Trafficked women tattooed by their pimps Redsky says the history of racism against indigenous Canadians feeds into the cycle of violence and exploitation against them  It is really difficult to be able to fight those stereotypes as indigenous women when a whole society is targeting indigenous women and girls  particularly for violence and abuse    and that spills over into sex trafficking  says Redsky  Tanay Little story shows how insidious the abuse can be  Little was just 11 when she was sexually exploited on the streets surrounding her family home in Winnipeg  An older girl  someone who pretended to be her friend she says  was actually preying on Little  first luring her with drugs and then trafficking her for sex  I remember one time that she put me in a room and then two guys  one  not together  but one would come in and then I would have sex with him and then the other the other guy would come in  And then I'd get high after that  says Little  She is blunt about what would happen if she refused to have sex with anybody  If you are not beat up  then you would get raped by a few of them at once  explains Little  There is a debt bondage that between $1 000 and $2 000 a day that these girls must bring  must hand in to their trafficker or else  says Redsky  These startling anecdotes have been heard in family homes  police stations and safe houses for years in Manitoba  The province is now taking the lead on an innovative approach to prevention and rehabilitation  Focus on the victims Redsky and others in Manitoba are now leading transformative programs to help identify the threats and risks so prevalent in indigenous communities  It is a new approach to help fight sex trafficking  one that focuses on the needs of the victims  Jennifer Richardson runs Tracia Trust  Manitoba strategy to combat sexual exploitation and sex trafficking of children  Crucially  Manitoba government has committed more than $10 million Canadian a year to fund it  a huge sum for a population of only about a million people  Within a 10 year span Manitoba has really grown this massive strategy that is just recognized throughout Canada as being kind of the frontier leaders in this area  says Richardson  Read: 'I was raped 43 200 times' The program is different and revolutionary for Manitoba because it uses not only targeted funds  but also words  deeds  and training to fight human trafficking in a whole new way  Outreach on neighborhood streets is one strategy that is executed with the help of law enforcement officers  Almost daily  Winnipeg Police dispatch an elite unit on the streets to try and counter sexual exploitation and human trafficking  The approach is a departure for Winnipeg Police  who now say their efforts are firmly focused on helping victims  Outreach is conducted in a way to help victims and then bring their perpetrators to justice  Law enforcement officials acknowledge a history of bias and racism that in the past prevented police from truly understanding how and why indigenous girls are vulnerable and at risk  There is bias in the police service  We recognize it  that there is implicit bias  We certainly have taken steps to try to address that in a myriad of ways  says Danny Smyth  Winnipeg deputy police chief  We have a team that dedicated just to outreach  Just to being out there and trying to get to know who is out on the street  and trying to establish a relationship with them  adds Smyth  The legacy of years of abuse and racism though are making it difficult for Canada indigenous community to heal and move on  Canada will soon launch an inquiry that will focus on why hundreds of indigenous women and girls have gone missing or been murdered over the years  Canadian and independent studies have revealed that indigenous women and girls are five times more likely to die in violent circumstances than non indigenous women and girls  We are still in a society that targets indigenous women and girls  In fact the national task force concluded that there is a market for indigenous girls  says Redsky  adding  what that leads to is a society who views indigenous women as less than  and in fact of no human value ,0,0,1,0,0

any type of child exploitation can be reported to the cyber tip line  said Olson  We make reports available to law enforcement in about 100 countries and we also work with Europol and Interpol  Swedish based company Griffeye was one of the founding partners of Project VIC  Director Johann Hofmann says it donates its software to be used in child exploitation cases  As more and more crime is becoming more and more digital as data is being distributed online  he said  You see a new type of police officer that is behind a computer screen and with the right tools they can crack these cases  The Internet has no borders so law enforcement agencies need to overcome traditional geographic boundaries to work together  Project VIC is now being used by Interpol  Europol and agencies in 35 countries including the United Kingdom and Canada  and it is about to be rolled out in Australia  In the United States the results speak for themselves  We've been absolutely floored by the success we've seen with Project VIC  said Cole  Going back a few years we were seeing victims in the low hundreds and in this past year we've rescued over 1 000 victims just in HSI (Homeland Security Investigations    a division of United States  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE))  alone and we've seen similar results in other agencies as well ,0,0,1,0,0

she was tired and wanted to go home  the people asked her to stay and talk and have a drink  Next thing she knew  she had been smuggled across the border to China  At that time  I wanted to leave  says Lan  There were other girls there in the car but there was people to guard us  The villages along the Vietnamese Chinese border are a hunting ground for human traffickers  Girls as young as 13 say they are tricked or drugged  then spirited across the porous border by boat  motorbike or car  Young Vietnamese women are valuable commodities in China  where the one child policy and long standing preference for sons has heavily skewed the gender ratio  To put it simply  Chinese men are hungry for brides  It costs a very huge amount of money for normal Chinese man to get married to a Chinese woman  explained Ha Thi Van Khanh  national project coordinator for the U N  anti trafficking organization in Vietnam  Traditionally  Chinese men wishing to marry local women are expected to pay for an elaborate banquet and to have purchased a new home to live in after the wedding  This is why they try to import women from neighboring countries  including Vietnam  Diep Vuong started the Pacific Links Foundation to combat trafficking in Vietnam  She says that Vietnamese brides can sell for upwards of $3 000 to the end buyer and that they are often considered desirable because of cultural similarities to the Chinese  Nguyen was just 16 when a friend boyfriend drugged her and smuggled her into China  She tried to resist a forced marriage  For three months  she refused  even though her traffickers beat her  withheld food and threatened to kill her  she says  Finally  she relented  She says her husband was kind to her  but she never stopped missing her family in Vietnam  My desire to go home was indescribable  Nguyen said  I agreed to marry the man but I could not stay with a stranger without any feelings for him  When her mother in law realized Lan was never going to warm to the marriage  the family returned her to the traffickers  They got their money back  Nguyen says  after which she was forced into a second marriage  A refuge for escaped women The Pacific Links Foundation runs a shelter for trafficking victims in the city of Lao Cai  northern Vietnam  The young women stay for an average of two to three years  They go to school or get vocational training  They do art therapy  They learn to cook and sew and keep a big garden  Surrounded by other woman with similar experiences  the shelter helps them get back on their feet and then to find jobs to support themselves  Once that whole investment process can happen with these young women then it is much easier for them to have their own lives  says Diep  Her organization also does community outreach to try and stop more girls from falling into the hands of traffickers  About once a month  a group of trafficking victims visits the market at Bac Ha  a regional hub for buying food  fabric and livestock  On this day  on a stage overlooking hundreds of shoppers  they talk about their experiences  take questions and play games with the crowd  When they ask people to share personal experiences concerning trafficking  more than 20 people come forward  I think awareness is the only tool  Diep says  Ha from the U N  agrees that the top priority is to spread awareness  especially in the poor  rural regions along the border  She also believes reducing poverty will help stop women going to China seeking work  another common way traffickers lure victims  Saved at the border During CNN trip to the border  the government called and told us the police had just rescued five girls as they were about to cross the border with a trafficker  We met the girls  who are just 14 years old  They said they were promised $600 to go to work in China by a neighbor from the same village  They didn't tell their parents they were going  The neighbor is now under arrest  The Vietnamese police are sometimes able to rescue women even after they have crossed into China  by enlisting the help of Chinese authorities  Nguyen Tuong Long  the head of the government social vice prevention department in Lao Cai  says last year they rescued and returned 109 Vietnamese trafficking victims  Because of cooperation between the Vietnamese and the Chinese police  we have found and caught trafficking rings  Nguyen says  We've found women far inside China  at brothels where they are forced to become sex workers  Trafficked women who aren't rescued in raids have to find ways to get out on their own  Some of them say they were able to contact their families from China  but they couldn't get help from police because they didn't know exactly where they were  Lan and Nguyen ended up in the same town in China  After two years  together they managed to slip out of their homes and take a taxi to a local police station  The whole time they were afraid their husbands' families would find them  The Chinese police investigated and eventually returned them to Vietnam  The women were free of their forced marriages  but they paid a high price  Both left their babies in China  Lan says if she saw her daughter again  she would apologize for leaving her behind  I hope she'll have a better life there  she says  Both Lan and Nguyen say in school their teachers had talked to them about trafficking  At the time  neither believed it could happen to them ,0,0,1,0,0

56,Not Applicable,By Ivan Oransky  New York University and Adam Marcus  Johns Hopkins University Have you heard that scientists are planning a march on Washington  The move is not being billed as a protest  but rather as a celebration of our passion for science and a call to support and safeguard the scientific community  although it comes as a direct response to recent policy changes and statements by the Trump administration  Not everyone thinks the nonprotest protest is a good thing  It is a terrible idea  wrote Robert Young  a geologist at Western Carolina University  in The New York Times  The march  Young said  will just reinforce a belief among some conservatives that scientists are an interest group  and polarize the issue  making researchers' jobs more difficult  Others find that argument less than convincing  pointing out that science and politics have always been intertwined  As the founders of the blog Retraction Watch and the Center for Scientific Integrity  we often see researchers reluctant to push for or embrace change   whether it is to the conventional way of dealing with misconduct in journals (which for years was basically to not do so) or addressing problems of reproducibility of their experiments  To the timorous  airing dirty laundry  and letting the public in on the reality of science  could endanger public trust   and funding  So this isn't the first time scientists and engineers have voiced similar concerns  Take the example of Marc Edwards and his colleagues at Virginia Tech: To many people watching the Flint water crisis  they were heroes  After being asked to visit by concerned residents  they found  and announced  that people in the beleaguered city were being exposed to excessive amounts of lead through their tap water  They also launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise money for water filters for city residents and created a website to push their findings about the hazards of the city water supply and shame governments at all levels to act  If not for their tireless efforts  thousands of children may have been exposed to dangerous amounts of lead for far longer than they already were  Even the Environmental Protection Agency has acknowledged that it waited too long to sound the alarm    But that not exactly how the editor of a leading engineering journal sees things  In October  a remarkable editorial appeared in the journal Environmental Science & Technology  The essay  by University of California  Berkeley engineering professor and Water Center Director David Sedlak  ES&T editor in chief  expressed concern that some of his colleagues in the field had crossed the imaginary line between scientist and advocate  Speaking out against a corrupt or incompetent system may be the product of a culture where idealism  personal responsibility  and Hollywood dramatic sensibilities conspire to create a narrative about the noble individual fighting injustice  Sedlak wrote  By becoming allies of a particular cause  no matter how just  we jeopardize the social contract that underpins the tradition of financial support for basic research  In other words  do not cross Congress   which many scientists already view as hostile to their profession   and risk retaliation in the form of budget cuts  That no small pie  either  Through its oversight of the National Institutes of Health  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  the Department of Energy and other agencies and programs  Congress holds the strings to a research purse worth nearly US$70 billion a year   Let take a moment to absorb all that  Some (unnamed but easily identified) scientists  lulled by the media  have cast themselves as superheroes in a struggle against villains born of their own conceit  Their arrogance and vanity threaten to awaken the master  who will punish us all for the sins of a few  We rarely get the opportunity to watch a chilling effect in action  but you can almost see the breath of researchers caught up in a debate over the proper role of scientists in the crisis  It is not just engineers who fear speaking out  We have too often been reluctant to voice our protest  for fear of incurring the [National Institute of Mental Health] displeasure (and losing whatever opportunities we still have for funding)  wrote neuroscientist John Markowitz in The New York Times last fall  In a refreshing piece  Markowitz was arguing that there is such a thing as too much neuroscience  As cofounders of Retraction Watch  a blog that focuses on some of science nasty episodes  we are occasionally admonished that pointing out cases of fraud   even when we also praise good behavior   will give anti science forces ammunition  In some ways  we should be glad scientists are acknowledging these concerns  instead of pretending they are never swayed by the almighty dollar  But anyone who clings to the notion that science exists in a pure vacuum  untainted by politics  economics or social justice needs also to understand that science is a human endeavor and scientists have the same eyes and ears for injustice and outrage as the rest of us  Although the conduct of science demands honesty and rigor  nowhere is it written that researchers must remain silent when governments or other powerful players either misuse science or suppress findings in the service of harmful policies  And before Edwards and his efforts on behalf of the Flint community  some scientists have spoken out  Claire Patterson  a physical chemist  put himself on a decades long collision course with industry when he took on lead poisoning  John Snow earned the ire of Londoners when he removed the pump handle on a cholera infested well  and was not vindicated until after his death  It took Peter Buxtun several years to stop the infamous Tuskegee syphilis experiment; he eventually had to leak documents to reporter Jean Heller in 1972  Edwards and his colleagues  we would argue  are part of a long tradition of bridging the worlds of science and policy  They have been instrumental in bringing not only attention but change to the beleaguered city of Flint  And money: Thanks in part to their pressure  the Senate in September voted overwhelmingly to approve $100 million in aid for Flint  and hundreds of millions more in loans from the Environmental Protection Agency for upgrading municipal water infrastructures and studying exposure to lead    In a stinging rebuke to Sedlak  Edwards and three coauthors   Amy Pruden  Siddhartha Roy and William Rhoads   blasted the critical editorial as a devastating  self indictment of cowardice and perverse incentives in modern academia  Indeed  scientists who accept funding with the tacit agreement that they keep their mouths shut about the government are far more threatening to an independent academy than those who speak their minds  Since Nov  8  it has been painfully clear that science will be playing defense for a while  The United States has never seen a regime so hostile to science and the value of the scientific method  President Donald Trump has declared climate change a hoax cooked up by the Chinese  He has flirted seriously with debunked anti vaccination views and declared that polls (read  data) that are negative about his ambitions are fake news  Science and politics are not always compatible  And science need not always triumph over policy: After all  research shows that steroids improve athletic performance  but we have a compelling political interest to ban them  The same can be said of eugenics  Research must always be ethical  and ethics is a conversation that includes scientists and policymakers  Still  while the two domains are separate  the divide is  and should be  bridgeable  As Edwards and his colleagues write  The personal and professional peril is great  the critics are numerous and vocal  but staying silent is to be complicit in perpetrating injustice  And no matter what may come of the rest of our lives or careers  we are certain of one thing: Flint was a community worth going out on a limb for  and by upholding a just cause  we enhanced the social contract between academics and the public  That could easily be said of the March for Science  Except now it is not just a limb but the entire tree that in peril  Ivan Oransky  Distinguished Writer In

58,Not Applicable,Many investors interested in alternative assets often shy away from art due to the overwhelming amount of risks and responsibilities that come with acquiring investment grade art  In this article  we identify these risks  and tell you how investing in art through Arthena will make you want to start today  Comparables  Experience and Costs: Needless to say  investment grade art is not the stock market or the real estate market where you can compare prices of one asset to another  With art assets  the ability to determine the legitimacy and the price  comes with expertise   this barrier makes it difficult for the traditional investor to confidently invest  When evaluating a work of art  art appraisers look for: Authenticity  condition  rarity  provenance  and value  Art appraisers' expertise can charge anywhere between $50 dollars to several hundreds of dollars an hour  and not all have equivalent experiences  Additional time is needed to ween out truly experienced art appraisers from those who are not  How can Arthena help  By investing through Arthena  we take away all the troubles of doing your own research  determining which work to purchase  placing the right bid  and hiring the right appraiser  At Arthena  we use our very own regression analysis to determine works of art to purchase for investment purposes  We organize artworks with similar core characteristics into logical groups according to their specific criteria  in accordance with USPAP (Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice) guidelines  which is also known as a IRS appraisal  The characteristics include artist  genre  date range  content  materials  size  coloration  and style  among others  Then  Arthena targets works by artists that have shown appreciation over the past 5 years and are projected to grow by 20% +/  YoY over the next five  or the lifetime of the fund  From storage to insurance  Arthena takes all these burdens away from the traditional art investor  By investing a minimum of $10k into our funds  we handle every troublesome task when it comes to acquiring a work of art  Just sit back  and watch your investment grow  Illiquidity: Generally  the art market is relatively illiquid in comparison to traditional assets such as equities and stocks  Therefore  art assets are ideal for long term investments  That being said  there is varying liquidity within the art market itself  Determined by the difference between the ask and bid price  the lower the bid price from the ask price  the more illiquid the asset is  The greater the bid is from the ask price  the more liquid it is  Let Arthena identify the art market most liquid assets: Arthena acquires works in the emerging  PWC  and Modern market sectors  which in total account for over 70% of the US market  and have shown the highest rate of growth over the past 10 years  Art market analysts have identified the most liquid sector of the art market are works of art under $250 000  Arthena confirms that the artist and art work fit our growth metrics  rate at 1 or above for Sharpe Ratio  to confirm that it is a high growth investment with low volatility  and determine its maximum acquisition price Lack of Data: Many reports have noted upon the lack of transparency in the art market  As a result  companies have created indices such as Mei Moses and Artnet index to amend this problem  Nonetheless  these indices bring in a new set of issues  Such indices as the two mentioned do not encompass the entire art market  For example  Mei Moses data lies primarily on numbers from Sotheby and Christie  negating their online sales as well as other auction houses and private sales  Another problem is that some indexes rely heavily on repeat sales  but does not include bought in lots  which variates some data  How Arthena operates through transparency: As such  Arthena acquires works at auction for increased price transparency to the benefit of our investors and our methodology  When works from Arthena index of artists appear at auction  Arthena uses regression modeling to determine maximum acquisition price  Once acquired  investors can view their art collection through Arthena online dashboard  allowing our clients to have full access into their investments   Stock market vs  art market performance: Multiple art market analysts have determined that the art market has a low correlation to the stock market  while other analysts have deemed that there is still a certain level of correlation between the two because of the notion that investors would only spend disposable income on collectibles and luxury assets when the market is bullish rather than vice versa  Regardless  the art market has proven itself to be a great store of wealth especially during times of economic uncertainty  Notably  it only took the art market 16 months to return to pre recession levels in 2008  while the stock market took six years  As such  according to Deloitte: Increasing awareness of art as an asset class: 53% of wealth managers had a high level of awareness of developments linked to art as an asset class  up from 43% in 2012 and 33% in 2011; this signals that increasing attention is being paid by the wealth management community to the art and collectibles market    Deloitte and ArtTactic Art & Finance Report 2014  Arthena takes a new approach to investing in art  Like a hedge fund  Arthena identifies specific market segments and artists that have shown impressive historical performance and creates buy orders to acquire said works  Do not

59,Not Applicable,WASHINGTON  Progressives wondering whether President Donald Trump will give any notice to their concerns hold out hope that his daughter Ivanka will intervene  Sen  Kirsten Gillibrand (D N Y )  a longtime champion of paid family leave  on Tuesday reintroduced her Family Act  which would guarantee 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave for all workers  The legislation  which proposes a universal paid leave program funded by a small payroll tax  failed to advance in the previous session of the Republican led Congress  and likely faces the same fate under Trump  But Gillibrand and Rep  Rosa DeLauro (D Conn )  sponsor of a companion bill in the House  on Tuesday expressed optimism that the president would be receptive  in part because Ivanka Trump has spoken about the issue  I am hopeful that the administration will reach out to me and work with me on a national paid leave plan  Gillibrand said on a call with reporters  Gillibrand referenced Ivanka Trump speech at last summer Republican National Convention  in which she presented her father  who has a record of demeaning women  as a champion for women rights and a supporter of equal pay for women  It led many progressives to hope that her influence would encourage  or at least make it possible  that the president pivot from his campaign promises  Ivanka Trump also tried during the campaign to deflect attention away from her father history of misogyny and climate change denial  Last week  Ivanka Trump and husband Jared Kushner  a senior White House adviser  reportedly convinced the president not to roll back LGBTQ protections  a important achievement of former President Barack Obama  Trump proposed paid leave plan  like most of his policy proposals  contains little substance and is limited in scope  It allows for six weeks of paid leave  and only applies to mothers  Ivanka Trump said in an interview when her father leave plan was announced in September that it is intended to help mothers in recovery in the immediate aftermath of childbirth  She would not elaborate on whether it would apply to LGBTQ  adoptive or foster parents  or people caring for aging parents  we'll wait to see what the dimensions of it  what the details are  DeLauro said of Trump proposal   I dont know when they will move forward with making a substantive proposal  she added  We'r waiting for them to join the debate  We'r on the field  The United States  remains the only industrialized country without mandated paid family leave  Sunday was the 24th anniversary of the Family Medical Leave Act  which provides 12 weeks of unpaid leave for people who work at companies with more than 50 employees  The push for universal paid leave is growing  with state legislatures and businesses enacting more expansive plans  Gillibrand said she hopes to gain bipartisan support because the issue affects everyone  Despite the fact that we dont have a Republican yet  I am optimistic that people will be demanding action on this issue  that people will rise up and say we need a national paid leave plan  and really call on their elected leaders to listen to the challenges that they'r facing  Gillibrand said  I am hopeful that the new administration will focus on it because they did run on it  they did talk about it  and it should be nonpartisan    1,0,0,1,0,0

61,Not Applicable,Ah  dating in the 21st century  If disappointing websites  drug resistant STIs and troublingly short attention spans werent enough to make us lose our minds (and possibly our libidos)  we'r also now stuck grappling with another modern phenomenon: ghosting  The New York Times defines ghosting as ending a romantic relationship by cutting off all contact and ignoring the former partner attempts to reach out  This has happened to me three times in the past year  Granted  I dont believe it necessarily needs to be a relationship in the traditional sense in order for one party to be ghosted  It could (or should) also include entanglements that involved meeting up or hanging out or hooking up with someone two or more times before the other person vanished without a trace  I havent been in a formal relationship in almost four years  but I frequently meet guys that I find worthy of getting to know better (both with and without my clothes on) and the exchanges that result from those interactions are meaningful to me in one way or another  at least meaningful enough to want some closure if or when they end  After investing some time and energy and possibly saliva or other body fluids in another person  it is disconcerting when they suddenly disappear  Of course  if you are only been on one or two dates (however you want to define that term) with someone and at the end of your time together neither of you reaches out to the other  that not ghosting  That just life  And I understand that dating is hard and that finding someone who ticks  or if we'r really lucky  tickles  all of our boxes is virtually impossible but I still (perhaps naively) cling to the (perhaps now radical and totally outdated) idea that it is a mature move to give someone a heads up if you'r going to stop talking or seeing or fucking them  So  in light of my experiences over the past year  here are a few humble and totally unscientific thoughts on ghosting: 1  Just dont do it  Be an adult and send a text that reads something like: Hey  Glad we hung out but I am just not feeling a connection  Stay awesome or whatever other generic and possibly hurtful or patronizing or maybe just uncomfortable (but at least emotionally clear) and instructive language you want to use  I'll respect you for it even if it bums me out and that way neither of us has to dread randomly running into the other at Whole Foods or at that bar with all those vintage pinball machines that I stupidly and regretfully introduced you to because I thought you were cool (or at least we wont experience more than the usual basic human level of dread that accompanies those kinds of surprise social interactions)  2  If you do it  do not  as two of the three guys who originally ghosted me have done  start texting me again three to four weeks later and pretend like nothing happened as if you unexpectedly slipped into a coma and then suddenly woke up again or went on a hot air balloon trip around the world and didnt have access to your phone and just forgot to tell me  The only thing worse than ghosting is re materializing a month later  and I mean worse for both of us because at that point  Ive had all that time to think about how bad your taste in music actually is or question a million other questionable things you told me in our short time together and now that Ive thought about it  I dont want to see you again  3  Being ghosted made me realize Ive probably ghosted guys in the past (and now that I am publishing this piece  I am guessing one or two or 74 of you will come forward and say as much)  If I ghosted you  I am sorry  I was an asshole  I was immature  And I was probably scared of hurting your feelings or just didnt know how to verbalize why I didnt want to see you again  Chances are it was something innocuous and had nothing to do with your character  And I am sure if you asked any of the guys who ghosted me  they say exactly the same things  But that doesnt excuse it and going forward I am vowing taking my own advice  no matter how awkward it might feel  4  Human beings are finicky creatures and  what is more  as our cultural ideas about and understanding of what dating and relationships and couples and families look like continues to shift and destabilize  linking up and breaking apart is probably only going to get trickier  These days many of us arent looking to get married or have kids (or at least arent looking to get married and have kids the way our parents or our grandparents did) and so  the way we think about how we enter and exit relationships is mutating and not always in ideal ways  which means we have to be even more mindful of our (in)actions  5  Communicating is hard  and getting harder  As much as I think the guys who ghosted me suck  I get it  And in many ways  aside from reminding me to treat others the way I'd like to be treated  being ghosted also has made me rethink who and what I am looking for in a partner or a fuck buddy  or just someone I want to go and have a donut with  What is more  it is made me rethink how I communicate with other human beings in general and reevaluate what the best way is to express myself and my needs and my desires to friends and family and colleagues  too  Email and texts make it easy to send a message but we have to stop to think about the quality of those messages  And are those forms of communication appropriate for what we need to say  What is the value of face to face contact and experiencing the world offline  What are the best ways to grow a relationship and how often do I rely on technology as a crutch to deal with  or get out of  something  These are all questions that have been pacing the hallways in my head lately and it feels good (or at least productive) to think about them  6  Ghosting aside  there is something kind of nice about dating as a 38 year old because I know what I want better than I did when I was 25 or even 32 and I put up with less shit  And if  in the end  someone doesnt text me back  the truth is I am totally happy to spend Friday night watching the Great British Bakeoff all by myself (maybe  if I am being totally honest  even happier) ,0,0,1,0,0

63,Not Applicable,Dear POTUS  This year  I am sending you a Valentine  not because I love you or respect you  but because I love my country  And you are the duly elected symbol of that country  You may not know that I love my country  since I am not in the pro life movement  I do not attend church  fear immigrants  or verbally wave the flag every chance I get  I am not even Christian  which I suspect is becoming ground zero for patriotism  In fact  I pretty much do not fit any of the recent descriptions used for those who love our country  My love of country stems  instead  from deep  unwavering gratitude  Gratitude that my parents were allowed to emigrate here  and that this country made room for them  Gratitude that I was given a childhood that was dramatically different than theirs  Gratitude that my life choices were those of people who have enough food to eat  a home to live in  and a government that protects them and not hunts them down  I had only to decide which clothes to wear for school that day  which homework assignment should be done first  and which children shows I would look forward to seeing on TV over the weekend  These were decisions my parents never got to consider when they were growing up  I also love my country because my experience growing up was that people of different religions living together was entirely normal  My friends were Jewish  Protestant  Catholic  We attended the same school  borrowed books from the same library  watched movies on Saturday morning at the same theater  My parents did not experience this  Because of their religion  they lived only where the government allowed them to live  Their lives were so insular that they never learned the languages of the countries in which they lived  This is what I'd like you to understand  that  because of who I am and because of the circumstances of my family history  I love my country  You and I speak the same language  and we may use the same terms  but I may mean something a bit different than you when I do so  For example: pro life: My belief is that life is sacred  and that being pro life means that we have an obligation to those  like my parents  who seek asylum within our borders  And we have an obligation to those who live here now  to be inclusive  Pro life means not shutting them out  either economically  socially  or educationally  I do not believe that they are here to suck us dry or kill us  I believe they are  like my parents  here to have a chance at a better life  radical Islamic terrorism: a favorite term of yours  You'll be happy to know that I believe radical Islamic terrorism exists and that it is a threat to us and to the world  I also believe radical non Islamic terrorism exists  It has resulted in Timothy McVeigh and the Oklahoma City bombing  Dylann Roof and the Charleston Church shooting  Adam Lanza and the Newtown School shooting  Charles Roberts and the Amish school shooting  Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold and the Columbine High School massacre  The list goes on and on  Terrorism  no matter its motivation  is unacceptable  government run education monopoly Democracies depend on the educational system they provide their citizens  Corporations that are monopolies have consumers at their mercy  and may set prices to increase profit  They do not have to consider the welfare of the people who use their products or services  Education  as a monopoly  ensures that common standards are upheld  They are beholden to the people who use their services  There is a big difference between a business and an educational system  People of means will always have the option of sending their children to private school  just as people of faith will always have the option of sending their children to faith based school  And people will (and should) have the option of home schooling or sending their children to charter schools  But none of these alternatives should impact in any way whatsoever on the public school system that the vast majority of Americans attend  Alternatives mean choice  not the standard  fake news: I agree wholeheartedly that fake news exists  But  in this era of unlimited avenues in which people can gather information  it is irresponsible to accept any news (no matter where it comes from) without checking sources  If you limit yourself solely to one source or one way of thinking  you become vulnerable to manipulation  And that is a very dangerous place to be  A free society is based on a free press  It is not up to any leader of this country to decide what people should read and/or listen to  It is up to us  the people to do due diligence to weed through news sources  in order to make ourselves better informed citizens  I also have definitions that differ from yours  regarding what it would take to make America great again and make the inner cities safe and keep our borders safe  I will happily share them with you  if you'd like  So  here your Valentine  POTUS  from a grateful to be here patriot of this amazing country  I suspect that no matter what path you choose to lead this country down for the foreseeable future  I will make my opinion known  I will continue to exercise the right that was not given to my parents  And I will continue to love this country as much as anyone possibly can and to get chills whenever I say the Pledge of Allegiance or sing the national anthem ,0,0,1,0,0

86,Not Applicable,Back in the mid 1990s  an economist called William Nordhaus conducted a series of simple experiments with light  First  he used a prehistoric technology: he lit a wood fire  But Prof Nordhaus also had a piece of hi tech equipment with him   a Minolta light meter  He burned 20lb (9kg) of wood  kept track of how long it burned for and carefully recorded the dim  flickering firelight with his meter  Next  he bought a Roman oil lamp  fitted it with a wick  and filled it with cold pressed sesame oil  He lit the lamp and watched the oil burn down  again using the light meter to measure its soft  even glow  Bill Nordhaus open wood fire had burned for just three hours on 9kg of wood  But a mere eggcup of oil burned all day  and more brightly and controllably  Why did he do this  He wanted to understand the economic significance of the light bulb  But Prof Nordhaus also wanted to illuminate a difficult issue for economists: how to keep track of inflation  the changing cost of goods and services  50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions  ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world  It is broadcast on the BBC World Service  You can find more information about the programme sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast  To see why this is difficult  consider the price of travelling from   say   Lisbon in Portugal to Luanda in Angola  When that journey was first made  by Portuguese explorers  it would have been an epic expedition  possibly taking months  Later  by steam ship  it would have taken a few days; then  by plane  a few hours  An economic historian could start by tracking the price of passage on the ship  but once an air route has opened up  which price do you look at  Maybe you simply switch to the airline ticket price once more people start flying than sailing  But flying is a different service   faster  more convenient  If more travellers are willing to pay twice as much to fly  it hardly makes sense for inflation statistics to record that the cost of the journey has suddenly doubled  It was to raise this question over the way we measure inflation that Bill Nordhaus started fooling around with wood fires  oil lamps and light meters  He wanted to unbundle the cost of a single quality that humans have cared deeply about since time immemorial  using the state of the art technology of different ages: illumination  Light is measured in lumens  or lumen hours  A candle gives off 13 lumens while it burns  A typical modern light bulb is almost 100 times brighter than that  Imagine gathering and chopping wood 10 hours a day for six days  Those 60 hours of work would produce 1 000 lumen hours of light  That is the equivalent of one modern light bulb shining for just 54 minutes  although what you would actually get is many more hours of dim  flickering light instead  Of course  light is not the only reason to burn fires: they also help keep you warm  cook your food and scare off wild animals  If you just needed light and a wood fire was your only option  you might decide to wait until the Sun comes up  Thousands of years ago  better options came along   candles from Egypt and Crete  and oil lamps from Babylon  Their light was steadier and more controllable  but still prohibitively expensive  In a diary entry of May 1743  the president of Harvard University  the Reverend Edward Holyoake  noted that his household had spent two days making 78lb (35kg) of tallow candles  Six months later  he noted: Candles all gone  And those were the summer months  The iPhone at 10: How the smartphone became so smart The steel box that changed global trade The hidden strengths of unloved concrete How the barcode changed retailing Nor were these the clean burning paraffin wax candles we use today  The wealthiest could afford beeswax  but most people   even the Harvard president   used tallow candles  stinking  smoking sticks of animal fat  Making them involved heating up animal fat and dipping and re dipping wicks into the molten lard  It was pungent and time consuming work  According to Prof Nordhaus research  if you set aside one whole week a year to spend 60 hours devoted exclusively to making candles   or earning the money to buy them   that would enable you to burn a single candle for just two hours and 20 minutes every evening  Things improved a little as the 18th and 19th Centuries unfolded  Candles were made of spermaceti   the milk hued oily gloop harvested from dead sperm whales  American founding father Ben Franklin loved the strong  white light they gave off  and the way they may be held in the hand  even in hot weather  without softening  and noted that they last much longer  While the new candles were pleasing  they were also pricey  George Washington calculated that burning a single spermaceti candle for five hours a night all year would cost him  8  or well over $1 000 ( 820) in today money  A few decades later  gas lamps and kerosene lamps helped to lower costs  They also saved the sperm whale from extinction  But they  too  were basically an expensive hassle  They dripped  smelt and set fire to things  Then something changed  That something was the light bulb  By 1900  one of Thomas Edison carbon filament bulbs would provide you with 10 days of bright  continuous illumination  100 times as bright as a candle  for the money you could earn with our 60 hour week of hard labour  By 1920  that same week of labour would pay for more than five months' continuous light from tungsten filament bulbs  By 1990  it was 10 years  A couple of years after that  thanks to compact fluorescent bulbs  it was more than five times longer  The labour that had once produced the equivalent of 54 minutes of quality light now produced 52 years  And modern LED lights continue to get cheaper and cheaper  Switch off a light bulb for an hour and you are saving illumination that would have cost our ancestors all week to create  It would have taken Benjamin Franklin contemporaries all afternoon  But someone in a rich industrial economy today could earn the money to buy that illumination in a fraction of a second  And of course our light bulbs are clean  safe and controllable   no flicker  pig fat stink or risk of fire  The light bulb has become an icon of innovation  It has transformed our society into one where we can work  read  sew or play whenever we want to  regardless of how dark the night has become  But the price of light alone tells a fascinating story: it has fallen by a factor of 500 000  far

87,Not Applicable,The claim: The green belt is safe from an increase in development  Reality Check verdict: The rules for developing green belt previously said that it was allowed only in exceptional circumstances  The government has now specified what would count as exceptional circumstances  It is not clear whether the new rules will be more or less strict than just letting councils decide what counted as exceptional circumstances  The government has described the housing market as broken  promised more affordable homes and said it would help people to buy and rent  A big question in discussions of increasing the supply of homes is whether planning regulations will be changed to make it easier to build on green belt land  Green belts were introduced after World War Two to stop cities from sprawling and countryside being spoilt  About 13% of England is now covered  This covers scenic sites open to the public  such as the Chiltern Hills and North Downs  but it also covers a lot of land that has limited public access and may not be particularly beautiful  In the House of Commons  Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said: In 2015  we promised the British people that the green belt was safe in our hands and that is still the case  So what has changed  There has been little variation in the amount of green belt land since 1997  although data is not available for every year  The Housing White Paper says the current planning regulations allow building on the green belt only in exceptional circumstances but that there is no detail given of what would amount to exceptional circumstances  The government has now specified that before allowing development on green belt land  councils would need to rule out options including: The White Paper also says that councils allowing the boundaries of green belt land to be changed would have to make up for it by improving other bits of green belt  It also asks for suggestions of other things councils should take into account before doing so  Read more from Reality Check,0,0,1,0,0

89,Not Applicable,Qatar Airways has launched what it says is the longest current non stop commercial route  after completing a journey from Doha to Auckland  Flight QR920 landed on Monday after 16 hours and 23 minutes  slightly quicker than expected  The Boeing 777 200LR jet was showered with water cannons on arrival   a tradition for airlines on new routes  Carriers like to talk up these records  but how are they measured and do they really matter  Longest (time) or furthest (distance) are the two key distinctions to make  but it is not as simple as it might sound  The distance between two cities does not vary for airlines of course  but they might choose to take alternative routes  For example  a carrier might choose to avoid flying over certain countries which can alter how far a plane flies from point A to point B  And airlines have been known to take unconventional routes  In October last year  Air India flew Delhi to San Francisco by crossing the Pacific rather than the Atlantic   a direction switch which added an extra 1 400km to the journey  making the 15 127km trip the longest ever non stop flight by distance  By comparison  Qatar new route is 14 535km  But regardless of the route  flight time is dependent on headwinds or tailwinds  For example  Qatar return leg from Auckland to Doha is expected to take about 18 hours because of headwinds  And though Air India went the long way round  favourable tailwinds meant the journey took about two and a half hours less than its conventional route  The longest flying time does not always correspond with the longest distance  says Ellis Taylor of Flightglobal  Of course  from a passenger perspective  the flying time is probably the best measurement  Record breaking flights may make headlines  But new long haul flights mean nothing if they are treated as a standalone route  says Mr Taylor  Rather  it is what a new route brings to the airline existing network  On its own  it wouldn't be viable to fly between Auckland and Doha  but Qatar is focusing on the passengers from Auckland going on to Europe  Africa  the US or elsewhere  says Mr Taylor  In that light  even though it may take some time for the route to stack up from a profit perspective  it may help the economics of its wider network  Historically  most of the major long haul routes have been serviced by legacy airlines like Singapore Airlines and Australia Qantas  But adding new routes have allowed newer airlines like Qatar  and perhaps most notably Emirates  to expand their business very rapidly  It is also about reach for Middle East airlines striving to outdo each other  says Geoffrey Thomas of Airlineratings com  Longest flight records will continue to change hands as airlines launch new routes  and the range capability of aircraft improves  Last year  for example  Qantas revealed it would fly direct between Perth and London from March 2018  a flight that will take 17 hours  The price of fuel and the types of planes which airlines buy will be the determining factors in opening new routes With the arrival of the 777 8X in 2022  new records such as flights from Sydney to New York and Sydney to London will be set  says Mr Thomas  The 777 8X will be the ultimate long haul airliner  But remember  for routes to be viable  they also require people to buy tickets  That depends on passengers being willing to sit in their seats for 16  17 or maybe 18 hours at a time  How long that desire will last (especially for travellers cramped up in economy) is something airlines will monitor carefully ,0,0,1,0,0
90,Not Applicable,Donald Trump says he is defending the United States from terrorism   but a so called judge is making the job very difficult  But the judge   in halting the president controversial executive order on immigration   said he was making sure President Trump actions follow the law  That sets two theoretically equal branches of the government against one another   and could bring about a crisis  The separation of powers is crucial to understanding how the US is governed  The country constitution established its treasured system of checks and balances   where the different branches of government hold equal authority and offset one another  The federal government power is split into three distinct parts   the executive branch  which includes the president and his cabinet; the legislative branch  Congress  which makes the laws; and the judiciary  This works well most of the time  with each branch co operating with the next  But with the president in open conflict with another branch  there are fears that an impasse could be reached  That could lead to a constitutional crisis   a scenario in which the situation cannot be resolved   particularly after Mr Trump seemed to openly question the judge authority  The President hostility toward the rule of law is not just embarrassing  it is dangerous  Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy  from the Senate judiciary committee  said  He seems intent on precipitating a constitutional crisis  There are about 700 federal district judges in the US   the type facing down the president order  Unlike state court judges  these men and women are part of the federal court system   along with the Supreme Court and the Courts of Appeals  Day to day  it is the 94 District Courts which deal with interpretation of US laws  treaties  and public officials   powers devolved to them from the Supreme Court  The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases  in Law and Equity  arising under this Constitution  the Laws of the United States  and Treaties made  or which shall be made    But the courts do not offer opinions on government policy unless they are asked   they only interpret law when a case is brought before them  The other two branches of government make and enforce the laws  and the judicial branch interprets the laws when there is a dispute  That is the issue here   a presidential executive order has all the force of law  and is subject to the same checks  Those judicial powers have been used many times before  Barack Obama faced stumbling blocks in 2015 when he attempted to use an executive order to grant a reprieve to undocumented immigrants  and George W Bush faced similar battles over detainees in Guantanamo Bay  It is true that district judges are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate  Judge James Robart  for example   the so called judge of Mr Trump Twitter criticism   was appointed by President George W Bush and confirmed in 2004  But Mr Trump can not fire judges  That because the founding fathers of the United States created a system to protect the judiciary from interference  Only Congress can remove a federal judge from office through impeachment  which involves both the House and Senate  It is the same system used to remove a president  This article three protection is  in practical terms  very rigid  Only eight judges have been convicted in an impeachment trial in the entire history of the United States  The end result is that federal judges usually serve until they choose to retire   or until death  In effect  two of the country three branches of government are in conflict   and neither can remove the other  Inside the mind of Donald Trump Which executive actions will have the most impact  Tech world caught between Trump and a liberal place The Supreme Court  as the name implies  has ultimate power in the judiciary   the other courts are inferior to it  In this case  the government could have taken its appeal against the district rulings straight to the Supreme Court   and may still do so  Nine seats make up the court Four were appointed by Democrats: two by President Clinton  and two by President Obama Four were appointed by Republican Presidents: George W Bush  George Bush Snr  and Ronald Reagan One seat is vacant following the death of Antonin Scalia  Just as with the other federal courts  though  the Supreme Court is protected from interference  But there are currently only eight judges on the Supreme Court  Four were appointed by a Democrat  and four by a Republican   with one vacant seat waiting to be filled by Mr Trump nominee  which could swing the balance of power  Congress could break any deadlock that crops up between the president and the judiciary by creating a law that overturns his decision   or even impeaching a president or judge  Since Mr Trump Republican party holds a majority there  action against the president seems unlikely  And the independence of the courts is so essential to the US way of governing  that moving to attack judges on behalf of the president would be a drastic step  Nonetheless  with two of the three powers in conflict  the decision may fall to Congress eventually   unless Mr Trump modifies his order  That may be the most prudent move  in keeping with his predecessors who have often backed off in the face of judicial opposition  For now  though  Mr Trump just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril   and shows no signs of changing his mind ,0,0,1,0,0
91,Not Applicable,President Trump first week in office was widely regarded as a whirlwind  His second week has been no less hectic  Despite the mass protests of week one and falling approval ratings  the administration appears to be doubling down on its pledge to shake up the Washington playbook  In a divided America  many people are repelled by the agenda and tone of this administration  while many others are pleased that their president is taking a bold stand and getting things done  Here are five key things from week two in Trumpland  On Friday  a week after his inauguration  President Trump issued an executive order suspending all refugee admissions for 120 days  banning Syrian refugees indefinitely and suspending arrivals from seven Muslim majority countries for 90 days  The immediacy of the announcement  which Mr Trump said was necessary to not allow any lag time for bad dudes to sneak in  caused widespread confusion at airports around the world  Families were separated  and even Green Card holders from the affected countries were initially included in the ban  An Iraqi who put his life at risk as an interpreter for the US army was among hundreds of people detained at airports  Around the world  travellers were prevented from boarding planes  and in some cases  were pulled off flights  Vetted refugees waiting to travel to the US despaired  An Iran born BBC reporter with British citizenship was among those temporarily detained  Demonstrators flocked to airports in protest  with many lawyers offering their services for free and filing emergency motions to have people released  Mr Trump said the restrictions were required so new security measures could be put in place to protect America from possible terrorist attacks  Things were working out very nicely  he said  Steve Gruber  a popular talk show host in Michigan  summed up the mood among many Trump voters  Listeners  he said  are encouraged that a politician  albeit a new one  is actually doing the things he said he would do  Several courts moved to block parts of the order being implemented  but reports said that border officers in some places were not complying with the rulings  As condemnation grew  including from a few top Republicans  many foreign governments and major US companies  the White House insisted it was not a Muslim ban  pointing to the many Muslim majority countries not involved  Thousands join protests across UK But former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani undermined that claim  admitting to Fox News that Mr Trump had previously asked him how to legally implement a ban on Muslims  He said  however  that the ban implemented was based on danger  not religion  Sean Spicer  the White House combative press secretary  blasted journalists for reporting it as a travel ban  even though his boss used that very wording on Twitter  Meanwhile  the world tried to figure out the unique language on display at protests in Scotland  The immigration order fallout dominated headlines for most of this week  This has proven to be an embarrassing episode in what looks like a not ready for primetime White House  our correspondent Anthony Zurcher wrote  Amateur hour at the White House  But President Trump supporters think he is doing a great job  The former reality TV star now in the White House was this week finally given a chance to fire someone  In the middle of the furore over the immigration ban  acting attorney general Sally Yates ordered justice department lawyers not to enforce President Trump executive order  Within hours  she was dismissed and accused by President Trump of betraying her department and being weak on borders  Some observers and journalists asked whether the dismissal would have a chilling effect across government  But the White House said justice department lawyers had deemed the order legal and thus Ms Yates was not fulfilling her duty  The move came on the heels of other comments from the administration suggesting that dissent from officials would not be tolerated  As news spread on Monday that hundreds of US diplomats around the world were planning to use a dissent channel to argue that the immigration restrictions would not make the US safer  Sean Spicer said they should either get with the programme or they can go  That seemed like a pretty direct message to US government employees with independent views  On Tuesday evening at a White House ceremony  Donald Trump unveiled his pick to fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court   Judge Neil Gorsuch  of Colorado  The Democrats  whom the administration has chastised for seeking to stymie them at every opportunity  have hinted they will use all means at their disposal to block his confirmation in the Senate  The Supreme Court has the final say on such divisive issues such as abortion  gun control and gay rights  Since Judge Antonin Scalia died a year ago  the court has been split equally between liberal and conservative justices  at four each  Whoever holds the ninth seat is thus pretty significant  though justices do not always split on clear ideological lines  Barack Obama tried to replace Mr Scalia with a nominee of his choice  but the Republicans didn't allow it given an election was forthcoming  Like the late Mr Scalia  the Ivy League educated Mr Gorsuch is known to support textualism  or the interpretation of law according to its plain text  He also maintains a strict interpretation of the US Constitution  or how it was originally understood by the Founding Fathers  Who is Neil Gorsuch  Why is the US Supreme Court so important  House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi called the nominee a very hostile appointment and a very bad decision  well outside the mainstream of American legal thought  And of course  there were more protests  Stephen Bannon  Donald Trump chief strategist  is a man who many people believe is behind much of what has come out of the White House in the past two weeks  The former executive chairman of populist  conservative news website Breitbart has been described as a rumpled right wing agitator by the New York Times  On Saturday night  he was given a seat on the National Security Council inner circle  or principals' committee  Under the restructuring  the Joint Chiefs and director of national intelligence have been told only to attend when discussions pertain to their areas  The move shocked many Washington veterans  It is completely unprecedented to have a political adviser as a member of that group  Eliot Cohen  director of the Strategic Studies Program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies  told the BBC  Mr Bannon has a destructive world view and has accumulated an unhealthy level of power  he said  describing it as an ominous move  What exactly is his destructive world view  Well  according to the Daily Beast  in 2013 Bannon said he wanted to bring everything crashing down  and destroy all of today establishment  The White House tried to brush the changes off  pointing to the fact that Obama adviser David Axelrod had been included in some council meetings  Mr Bannon jokingly referred to himself as Darth Vader in a recent interview where he described US media as the opposition party  Steve Bannon will now sit at a table where issues pertaining to US national security  and thus global stability  are discussed at a very  very senior level  Refugees are very much on President Trump radar at the moment and it is well known that he likes to talk about deals  But a phone call on the subject on Saturday between the US president and the Australian PM  which was scheduled to last for an hour  was cut short from the White House after just 25 minutes  President Trump said the conversation with Malcolm Turnbull  in which they discussed a refugee resettlement deal between the two nations  was not a favourite among calls he had taken with world leaders  In fact  the Washington Post reported that Mr Trump described the conversation as the worst by far  He appeared to be somewhat irritated by the subject matter   a deal struck with the Obama administration which would see up to 1 250 asylum seekers to Australia resettled in the US  What next  President Trump was so worked up after discussing the worst deal ever that he decided to issue a statement in his preferred manner   via Twitter  Mr Trump tweeted that he would study this dumb deal  Later  Mr Spicer gave an official version of his boss 25 minute call with Mr Turnbull  He said that both leaders had emphasised the enduring strength and closeness of the US Australia relationship  Mr Turnbull later thanked President Trump for agreeing to uphold the deal  Trump first week: Well  that was intense,0,0,1,0,0
92,Not Applicable,Our bathrooms are filled with shampoo bottles  toilet rolls and cleaning products which could easily be put into our recycling bins when finished with  Yet research shows our green intentions are washed away as soon as we step near a toilet  Now a business group has come up with an idea for how to combat this problem   two bathroom bins  The Circular Economy Taskforce  who were brought together by Prince Charles Business in the Community environment charity  says it could boost recycling  So should two bins really sit alongside your stack of loo roll in the bathroom  Why should people have two bins in their bathrooms  It is trying to address the problem that people are less likely to recycle packaging for things we use in our bathrooms than for things we use in other rooms of the house  says Jonny Hazell  senior policy adviser for environmental think tank Green Alliance  The Recycle Now campaign points to its statistics  which show that while 90% of packaging is recycled in our kitchens  only 50% is being recycled in the bathroom  Often homes have one central recycling bin located in the kitchen  so when in the shower or washing your face it can be tricky to remember to transfer it to that bin  it says  This is why having a recycling bin or bag in the bathroom might be useful  if there is space  Business in the Community says two bins could make it easier to separate out the plastics that can be recycled  But it does not have to be a bin  it could be as simple as a bag on the door handle that you bring down to the kitchen every week  it added  Where has this idea come from  While recycling has grown from 12% to 45% in the UK over the last decade  campaigners say the bathroom is an area that needs more focus  The Circular Economy Taskforce came up with the idea as part of its work looking at practical collaborative ways to boost recycling and re use rates  The bathroom is one of the areas that has come up time and time again in the group as somewhere where both business and consumers can make a difference to help us all reduce our impact on the environment  says Business in the Community  Thinking about how different types of bins could boost recycling in the bathroom is just one example of a potential simple solution that could have a big impact  Why are people failing to recycle their bathroom products  Campaigners believes it comes down not just to where a recycling bin is located but also to confusion over what can be recycled  Recycle Now says: There can also be confusion about what can or can not be recycled with bathroom products  For example many people do not realise that bleach bottles can be easily recycled   simply make sure it is empty and put the lid back on  Recycling just one bleach bottle saves enough energy to power a street light for 6 5 hours  so the value quickly adds up  Research from the University of Exeter also found that people who threw away waste in the bathroom saw it as being dirty and were less likely to recycle it  Going through your bathroom bin to separate out what can and can not be recycled can seem off putting  says Business in the Community  It added: There is also a lot of confusion around what can be recycled in the bathroom  for example many consumers are confused by aerosols  How much recyclable waste comes from a bathroom  A surprising amount  Typical products include: Plastic shampoo  conditioner and shower gel bottles  plastic moisturiser bottles (such as for hand cream and body lotion)  glass face cream pots (plus the cardboard packaging they come in)  perfume and aftershave bottles  aerosols for deodorant  air freshener and shaving foam  bleach and bathroom cleaner bottles  toothpaste boxes and toilet roll tubes  Is a lack of recycling in bathrooms a real problem  Every little helps  is the message from environmental and recycling groups  In general  the less we recycle  the more water and energy we need to use to produce the materials we use in our daily lives  said Mr Hazell  Recycle Now says recycling reduces the amount we are sending to landfill and makes use of resources already available rather than making them from scratch  Ultimately this means reduced levels of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere which contribute to climate change  it added  For instance it takes 75% less energy to make a plastic shampoo bottle from recycled plastic compared with using virgin materials  Can two bins have a meaningful impact on recycling overall  Ensuring you recycle in the bathroom can make a big difference  says Recycle Now  It would save  135 000 in landfill costs if every UK household threw their next empty shampoo bottles into the recycling bin  On top of this  if everyone recycled one more toilet roll tube it would save enough cardboard inner tubes from landfill to go round the M25 38 times  But what if you do not have the space for two bins  There are other options  Hang a reusable bag on the bathroom door so you can transfer your recyclable items straight into the recycling bin  Or opt for a bin with split compartments which can be used to separate recyclable and non recyclable items ,0,0,1,0,0

99,Not Applicable,Whether after four years or eight  all US presidents must eventually confront the question: What happens when I leave the Oval Office  For Barack Obama  the answer was a five star Caribbean holiday   and a seemingly endless grin  The former commander in chief has been pictured beaming on a beach in a backwards cap  flanked by an equally cheery Michelle  The venue for this masterclass in chilling  Necker island in the British Virgin Islands  owned by British billionaire Sir Richard Branson  Sir Richard posted pictures on his blog of Mr Obama learning to kite surf  and engaging in a play fight with the businessman  The airline mogul said he invited the Obamas for a complete break on his private island after they left the White House  Not every president wants a sunshine stay after the West Wing doors swing shut  however  So which leaders picked elephant hunting  marrying a relative  and a sideline in oil painting     When the 43rd president left office in January 2009  he ditched Washington for a quiet life between a house in Dallas  Texas  and his 1 500 acre Prairie Chapel Ranch  Keen to enjoy his retirement  the sexagenarian took weekly painting lessons  His subjects included Russian President Vladimir Putin  Tony Blair  and the Dalai Lama   as well as his pets  His inspiration was his great hero Sir Winston Churchill  who turned to art in his forties as a refuge from the tumult of politics  George W Bush paintings go on display Obama asks: What shall I do now  Spotify job offer for Barack Obama When I get to heaven I mean to spend a considerable portion of my first million years in painting  and so get to the bottom of the subject  the wartime leader reportedly said  Mr Bush was less patient  telling his art teacher: There is a Rembrandt trapped in this body  And your job is to find it  Despite being nicknamed 'Teddy' and famously refusing to shoot a bear  the 26th president took a year long African hunting trip with his son  Kermit  in 1909  The duo were accompanied by more than 200 porters  and scientists from the Smithsonian Institution  They made their way round Africa dispatching over 11 000 animals   including elephants  rhinos  hippos  snakes  zebra  and monkeys among others   before shipping the carcasses home for scientific study  Another exotic trip followed for Mr Roosevelt (and Kermit) in late 1913  when they joined Brazil most famous explorer Candido Rondon to chart the course of the River of Doubt  The 760km (472 mile) stretch was ultimately renamed Roosevelt River in his honour  The aforementioned Teddy Roosevelt had no time for Benjamin Harrison  president from 1889 93  branding him a cold blooded  narrow minded  prejudiced  obstinate  timid old psalm singing Indianapolis politician  But none of that stopped the 23rd president from wedding a woman 25 years his junior  who also happened to be his niece by marriage  Mr Harrison first wife  Caroline  had died of tuberculosis in 1892  When he wed Mary Dimmick four years later  his two adult children refused to attend the ceremony  America first president lived only two years after leaving the job   and spent them making whiskey  In 1799  the year of his death  his distillery in Mount Vernon  Virginia  produced nearly 11 000 gallons   making it the largest in the US at the time  Also a livestock farmer  the founding father used leftovers from the whiskey making to fatten his pigs  As for the distillery   it is still going  selling its golden product to tourists at the Mount Vernon Estate and museum ,0,0,1,0,0
100,Not Applicable,Owning a home by the age of 25 has become an unachievable dream for many over the last two decades  Soaring property prices mean just one in five 25 year olds own a property  compared to nearly half two decades ago  according to one recent study  But as the government unveils its Housing White Paper  there are some young people who have managed to buck the trend   without help from the bank of mum and dad  Here four young homeowners   all couples   who bought properties in 2016   reveal just how they did it  Name: Mark Hepburn  age 23  A debt collector on  18 500 a year Lives with: Partner Laura Starkie  age 25  An accountant on  20 000 a year Location: Oldham  Greater Manchester House price:  125 000 for a three bedroom semi detached house Deposit:  6 250 (5%) with the Help to Buy mortgage scheme (which ended in December) Why buy a property  We were sick of living at home with each of our parents and wanted our own space  I'd rather live in a house than just a bedroom  We discussed moving out and renting  but we both agreed it was dead money  How did you do it  There was a lot of budgeting  I literally know where every penny goes  I had to drill it into Laura a little bit  but she got used to it after a while  Like her make up   she had to go for a cheaper brand  We were both working at McDonald when we were saving and if there were extra shifts  we would take them  Did you make any sacrifices  There was definitely a lifestyle change when we were saving  We would buy supermarket budget stuff instead of brands  We didn't go on holiday during the time we were saving up   and that was a massive thing for Laura  How does it feel to be a home owner  I feel ridiculously happy  I feel proud and our friends are too because they know we worked extremely hard for it  Once you get there  you do not need to worry as much  What if you need to move  I recently went for a job in Bolton  which is not that close to where we are now  The salary was  27 000 per year  but I wouldn't move house for that  It would have to be significantly higher to consider jobs away from where we are now  Reaction from friends  I can not count how many times our friends have asked us how we've done it  We just explain you need to save  watch your money and cut back  They are happy for us and we are just trying to get it into them not to leave it too long and to start saving  Should more young people be able to buy a home  I have got mixed opinions  When Laura and I were at McDonald we were on a combined salary of  23 000 and we managed to save up  7 000 between us within a year  So I do not see how people can not do it  But then we do not have any kids  The Help to Buy mortgage scheme was a God send  But if you are stopping something that so good and helping young people  it is going to cause mayhem  Name: Ruby Willard  age 22  A recruitment consultant on  19 000 a year plus commission Lives with: Partner Sam Bardell  age 22  An engineer on  24 000 a year plus overtime Location: Havant  Hampshire House price:  182 200 for a two bedroom terraced house Deposit:  18 220 (10%) with the Help to Buy Isa Why buy a property  It was a case of living at home  I moved back into the box room of my mum house and I hated it  Sam lived with his parents too so we thought if we can  let do it   so we decided to save and go for it  We were looking at renting but to us it was like throwing away money  How did you do it  Being quite tight is probably the answer  When we decided we were going to buy  I thought I am not going to spend money elsewhere when I do not need to  We did still have a nice holiday to Greece  I get commission and Sam gets overtime so we probably earn  55 000 overall  which meant we were in a position we could borrow maybe more than people on minimum wage  Did you make any sacrifices  We may have not had such a big social life  We still did things  but we were conscious  What I did was save what I knew I needed to save  and lived on whatever I had left   which was usually about  200 a month  I was not buying lunch at work  which would save about  25 a week  How does it feel to be a home owner  It was weird at first  When we got the keys it was like are we on holiday  When things started to come together it felt like such an achievement  Everything we had chosen not to do  not going to the cinema one night  helped towards it  What if you need to move  We would be open to the idea  but we would probably look for work closer to where we bought a house  so it probably would affect future decisions  If we did decide we wanted to go somewhere else  we would probably look to sell the house and hopefully we will have made some money on it  Reaction from friends  It is been quite positive  I have got friends that have bought houses  but a lot of them have had big lump sums of money given to them  Should more young people be able to buy a home  Neither of us completed three years at university  so we probably established a career path earlier than those that do go  I speak to a lot of people that have graduated  and they cannot find jobs that will allow them to borrow enough  It takes years to save a deposit  and then house prices go up and they can not borrow enough  I think this is how it is now  You might also like    Name: Andrew Douglas  age 23  A social worker on  31 000 a year Lives with: Partner Kirsty Lamb  age 24  A pharmacist on  35 000 a year Location: Moredun  Edinburgh  House price:  145 000 for a two storey terraced house with two bedrooms Deposit:  21 750 (15%) with the Help to Buy Isa Why buy a property  We decided we wanted to get on the property ladder as quickly as possible  If we get on it now  we would be able to buy what we want by the time we are older and looking to have a family  How did you do it  We started saving at the beginning of 2015 and were probably saving between  400 and  500 a month each  We did go on a couple of holidays  so although we've been saving  we've still been living  We weren't scrimping  but we do only spend about  30 a week on food  We check receipts and look for the best deals  so that is more thrifty than most people  Did you make any sacrifices  We spoke about going away for three weeks to somewhere like Australia  but we thought   it is going to cost  2 000 each and we can put that towards the house now rather than waiting a few extra months  How does it feel to be a home owner  It feels strange  It does feel like quite a lot of responsibility   I didn't realise how much  Things like taking out mortgage protection  Our friends call it adulting hard  They are renting and not really thinking about owning a place and they are like wow  you've bought a house  Reaction from friends  Lots of people think it is really good  other people say they are nowhere near that stage  I do not know if they are thinking I am growing up too fast  It is generally been positive  I do not know anyone who has done it without a partner  so I think it would be difficult to do it on your own  What if you need to move  With a big move we might give it a trial  and rent out this house while we lived somewhere else  Should more young people be able to buy a home  I do think people complain they can not afford to buy a house but they go out every weekend  they smoke or they eat out all the time  But property prices have also shot up in the last 20 years with more people buying second homes  There are also people who do not want to have the responsibility  I think it is good that the government is helping with Help to Buy schemes and it needs to do more to help first time buyers  Name: Rebecca Thompson  aged 23  An information analyst on  21 900 a year  Lives with: Adam Drinkwater  aged 25  A bank administrator on  16 500 a year  Location: Irlam  Greater Manchester House price:  126 500 for a three bedroom semi detached house Deposit:  6 300 (5%) with the Help to Buy mortgage scheme and Isa Why buy a property  We lived in a rental flat together for 18 months and realised that the amount we were paying in rent was more or less the same as we would be paying with a mortgage  When we were renting there were a lot of things we couldn't do  like decorate or move anything around  How did you do it  It was difficult  I was working part time in my final year at university so I saved my entire wage and lived off my student loan  which was not much  We didn't go on holiday that year and saved as much as we could  Did you make any sacrifices  We came straight from university  where you are living on a bit of a shoe string anyway  so we probably sacrificed but not realised  because we've not been enjoying the extra income we've had since graduating  We would have probably gone on some more holidays or gone out more and probably bought a few more clothes  How does it feel to be a home owner  It is brilliant  I feel it is a really secure base while I am going on to develop my career  It is one less thing  A lot of people are aiming towards saving a deposit while I've got past it  What if you need to move  It would be really difficult  and it is definitely an attraction for staying where I am  In my career there are a lot of opportunities down south  but I wouldn't want to entertain it because of the house prices  It would take us five times longer to save up a deposit  and the amount of income you need to get for a mortgage is totally unobtainable for the average graduate  Reaction from friends  Some live in a more expensive area and I think they were surprised  It is not something that on a lot of people radar  owning a home at this age  Particularly if you are not in a relationship  I do not think it is affordable  Should more young people be able to buy a home  I think cultures have changed a bit  When my parents were growing up  their parents drilled into them ort yourself a house  get married and that when your life begins'  Now there is not as much of an emphasis  I think homes do need to be more affordable  It is silly that the town where we live in  a lot people can afford to buy   whereas only as far south as Birmingham no one can afford to buy a house earning what we do  Source: ONS  Department for Communities and Local Government  Land Registry Where can I afford to live,0,0,1,0,0
101,Not Applicable,The US president spokesman has caused a bit of a Twitter storm by claiming Mr Trump does not own a bathrobe  White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer accused the New York Times of printing inaccuracies  specifically referring to him watching TV in his bathrobe  saying the paper owed President Trump an apology  The president has tweeted his annoyance at what he calls poor reporting: The failing @nytimes was forced to apologise to its subscribers for the poor reporting it did on my election win  Now they are worse! Unsurprisingly  people have taken to social media to contradict Mr Spicer bathrobe comment with various hashtags popping up  including #BathRobeGate  Some have even been delving into the presidential bathrobe archives to produce gems such as this from Avi Bueno  He tweeted a photo of Ronald Reagan in a robe  with the caption: 'Weird to see @seanspicer and @realDonaldTrump getting all defensive about a #bathrobe when their hero was not shy about it  And historian Michael Beschloss tweeted a picture of President Lyndon B Johnson sitting in a robe with advisers on Air Force One in 1966  John Aravosis  editor of @AMERICAblog  was quick to post three photos of Donald Trump wearing a bathrobe  which had featured in a November Daily Mail article about a trove of Trump memorabilia being found in a US thrift shop  Considering the Trump Organisation lists 37 properties  including 15 hotels  on its website  many posters are assuming that a bathrobe or two may have been worn in the Trump household  Various robes bearing the Trump brand have been posted on social media  including this picture of American actor Mike Rowe  He tweeted a photo in August 2016 of a bathrobe autographed by Mr Trump  along with a video in which Mike says he wore the robe briefly  There were a few robe wearing alternatives  such as Evie the Cat  the UK Cabinet Office feline who posted this about the 10 Downing Street cat  Larry  And with a clever bit of editing  some have posted gifs of the president holding up a drawing of a bathrobe  Even @TrumpBathrobe  a twitter account set up in 2015 and inactive since September 2016  has reawakened amidst this robing furore  Similar posts are appearing on Facebook under #bathrobegate  although not everyone is impressed: Compiled by Sherie Ryder  BBC UGC and Social News team ,0,0,1,0,0
102,Not Applicable,US President Donald Trump has accused the media of under reporting terror attacks  and produced a list to back up his claim  Is he right  While on a visit to US Central Command  a wing of the Department of Defense  he warned of the danger posed by the Islamic State group  You have seen what happened in Paris and Nice  All over Europe it is happening  he said  It is gotten to a point where it is not even being reported  And in many cases the very  very dishonest press does not want to report it  They have their reasons  and you understand that  Later in the day  the White House published a list of attacks executed or inspired by IS  Before the list was published  press secretary Sean Spicer said there were several instances of attacks that had not gained sufficient media coverage (without specifying which fell into that category)  We have reproduced the list that was subsequently produced below  and explained what happened in each case and whether we reported on it  Just because the BBC covered an attack does not mean that incident was not under reported  although it is unclear whether Mr Trump was referring to US or global news organisations  Some terrorist

103,Not Applicable,This year Oscars class photo has been released   and as usual there are several quirks and questionable outfits  The picture sees 163 of this year nominees gathered together and smiling away  but zoom in and there is a whole lot more going on  Here are just seven of the things we spotted in this year photo  1  Pharrell Williams didn't exactly dress for the occasion All of this year male nominees are dressed smartly in tuxes and suits  Well  almost all  The dress code memo must have gone into Pharrell junk email inbox  because he turned up wearing a green baseball cap and grey sweater  To be fair   the sweater does have the Nasa logo on it  a reference to best picture nominee Hidden Figures  Pharrell wrote several songs for the soundtrack to the film  which tells the story of three African American women who worked behind the scenes at the space agency in the 1960s  2  Michelle Williams is upstaged by Casey Affleck facial hair Casey Affleck facial hair is fast becoming the eighth wonder of the world  It gets longer with every awards ceremony he appears at this season  It is now on the verge of totally eclipsing poor Michelle Williams  Affleck co star in Manchester by the Sea  who has to peep out from behind his mane  She must be used to Affleck stealing her limelight  The actor appears in nearly every scene in the 137 minute movie  while Williams screen time clocks in at 11 minutes  3  The writer of Moonlight wants you to know how many nominations it has Tarell Alvin McCraney brightens up the back row of the photograph with his winning smile  He is the man behind the stage play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue   which went on to become Moonlight  one of this year most hotly tipped Oscars contenders  McCraney is so pleased with the film success he wants to let you know just how many Oscar nominations the film has received  and he is seen here holding up eight fingers  (There is  of course  another explanation  He could be making the 305 hand gesture   which is the area code for Miami Dade county  his home and the place where Moonlight is set ) Also   hats off to Shawn Levy (who is standing next to Tarell)  who wins the award for the most delightfully bright smile of the whole photo  He is the producer of Arrival  which is nominated for best picture  4  Justin Timberlake needs to sack his tailor What is your inside leg measurement  Justin  I do not know  maybe 32 inches  Hmmm  I do not have enough material for that  Have a 28 inch pair of trousers instead  Great  that'll do  thanks Derek  5  The front row is so where we wanna be Emma Stone  Matt Damon  Natalie Portman  Octavia Spencer are all sitting together in the front row  Can someone please organise for us to join this BFF group  that'd be great  thanks  Extra respect for Octavia Spencer for wearing a pair of white trousers while so many of the other female nominees are in a dress or skirt  and for Natalie Portman  who manages to create the illusion she is impressively wearing high heels even while pregnant with twins  (She is actually wearing her flat shoes and tipping her heels up  Crafty ) Also   Manchester by the Sea producer Kimberly Steward (far right) is that sweet kid in your class who was accidentally never looking at the camera in the school photo every single year  6  Ryan Gosling needs to cheer up You are the lead actor in the jointly most nominated film of all time  pal  Uncross your arms for goodness sake  Slightly happier to be there is the lovely Dev Patel  in the row in front  looking every inch the Hollywood star  He is come a long way from how he looked at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2009 when he was starring in Slumdog Millionaire  He told the BBC: I first came to Toronto in my school shoes and I had a blazer and I was with Frida [Pinto  his co star] and they said 'You can not put this guy next to her because he looks so terrible'  I think I got a free penguin suit that didn't quite fit me and they gave me shoes  This year  he is nominated for best supporting actor and is seen wearing a burgundy Valentino suit  Nice  7  Is this gap for Meryl Streep  Missing nominees from the photo include Michael Shannon (nominated for best supporting actor for Nocturnal Animals) and Andrew Garfield (best actor  Hacksaw Ridge)  But of course  the most notable absentee is Her Royal Acting Highness  Meryl Streep   who is up for best actress this year for her role in Florence Foster Jenkins  Maybe this gap in the back row behind Denzel Washington was intended for her  and she got held up in traffic  Alternatively  perhaps she is been to so many of these things she is just had enough  Either way  we are pretty sure she'll be at the ceremony  This year Oscars  which will be hosted by Jimmy Kimmel  will take place in Hollywood  Los Angeles on 26 February  Follow us on Facebook  on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts  or on Instagram at bbcnewsents  If you have a story suggestion email entertainment news@bbc co uk ,0,0,1,0,0

105,Not Applicable,Like many parents  I am the unofficial IT manager in my house  And  like many IT managers  my users are never happy with the service they get  The complaints have got louder over the past few months as I have tried to manage how much time two of them (my teenage children) spend online and to restrict what they see  A patchwork of different technologies help me do this  It includes: It works  after a fashion  but I know it has holes and that is why I also use a lot of sneakernet  This involves me walking around the house  kicking my kids off the game console  tablet  phone or TV (delete as appropriate) they are using when they should be doing homework  cleaning out the rabbit or getting ready for school  Research suggests I am not alone in using tech to oversee online time   both to limit it and to help them stay safe  About 44% of parents use apps to oversee online activity  39% check browser histories and 37% put controls on the router  suggests statistics gathered by security company Symantec  I use all three of those and want to use more  And it looked like technology was going to get even more useful as electronics companies released products with comprehensive parental controls onboard  It is perhaps no surprise that parents are keen to turn to technology to help manage time online  says Nick Shaw  European general manager at security company Norton  because it is one area where they struggle to find help  When people have a parenting problem with their children  they might go to their own parents for advice  he says  but this is the one area where your parents are not as clued up as you are  And  he says  children are even more clued up and easily capable of running rings around their parents  A lot of parents are very naive about this  he says  Even I got complacent because none of the tech I had put in place was sending me alerts  I thought it was all working fine and my children were browsing and gaming in an impenetrable bubble of safety  Wrong  Slowly I found out that by fiddling with system clocks  using safe mode and putting home PCs into sleep states  my two teenagers could avoid most of the locks and blocks  My schoolboy error  says Mr Shaw  was to let the hardware do the heavy lifting  Technology is going to help you  he says  but it is not going to get away from the fact that you should be having more conversations about this with your kids  What I should be doing  he says  is helping them to understand why the controls are needed  Explaining the reasons  he says  can help to defuse some of the objections  It is fair to say that my children and I have had some of these conversations  But they have been more of the play less games and do more maths type rather than the anti virus stops your YouTube account being stolen sort  Tony Anscombe  security evangelist at anti virus company Avast  says talking to children about safe ways to use the web is better than just imposing restrictions  Sure  he says  set some rules about how they should use it  but you should also educate your kids about basic security principles  A lot of parents just do not have the conversation  talking to them about what is acceptable and what is not  This should cover not sharing passwords and thinking before they share personal data such as contact information  images and videos  Naivety puts many children at risk  he says  and it is worth reminding them about what can be done with that information and who might want it  It might not just fall into the hands of cyber thieves  he says  it might also expose them to cyber bullying or just be inappropriate to share  Warnings about the hidden features in popular apps are worth passing on  he says  as they often seek to scoop up more information than they really need  The biggest and most important thing that parents can do is run the apps their children do  he says  This will help parents understand what information children might share and uncover any hidden features the apps possess  Some  he says  look innocuous but are designed to help children conceal what they are doing  Gadgets are only half the story  if that  says Dr Sonia Livingstone  from the London School of Economics  who studies how children use the internet  as part of her work with the long running EU Kids Online project  Companies should concentrate on doing less selling and more on designing services that do not need the protections they peddle  she says  In addition  she says  parents should encourage children to do the right thing by doing it themselves  rather than just by dictating terms  It is about respect too  she says  helping children make good decisions instead of arbitrarily imposing rules  If they can see the benefits of the rules  they are more likely to follow them  I am not very keen on the idea that parents have lots of control over their children  she says  Children have rights too ,0,0,1,0,0
106,Not Applicable,Football hooliganism is nothing new in Germany  but when violence broke out before a Bundesliga match between two of the top clubs  this was something different  The stones and bottles thrown and the hate banners displayed by Borussia Dortmund supporters on Saturday exposed a widespread loathing in Germany for a team seen as upstarts  RB Leipzig  The club is challenging for Champions League football in its first ever season in the top flight  The hatred is because of the way they are wholly owned by one company  Red Bull  A wall of hatred was on view: Slaughter the bulls  Red Bull  enemy of football were some of the milder slogans used  Families came under attack  and six fans and four police were hurt  One top football official Max Eberl said the violence was sick: Whether you like RB Leipzig or not  it shouldn't get out of hand  Dortmund fans are not alone  One tabloid newspaper  the Berliner Kurier  even refused to print the club name a few weeks ago  using the insulting term Dosenverkauf (Can sellers) in their Bundesliga table  Selling drinks is the core business of RB owner  Red Bull  and there have been plenty more insults since the company bought a team in the Leipzig suburbs in 2009 and oversaw four promotions in seven seasons  Listen to Tim BBC World Service programme here: The Rise of RB Leipzig The vitriol derives from RB ownership model  Traditionally German football clubs are run without a single  rich investor  It is the members who must control a majority of the shares in the entity that owns the team  But RB Leipzig has only 17 members  It follows the letter of this law  but not its spirit  Among the club biggest critics is the chief executive at Borussia Dortmund  Hans Joachim Watzke  It is a club built to push up the revenues for Red Bull and nothing else  he says  Read more on RB Leipzig here: RB Leipzig rapid rise 'no fairytale' Andreas Bischof  whose blog in Leipzig pokes fun at the new club  goes further  This club is not owned or sponsored by a company  this club is like an outlet of a company  he says  It is a whole new level of using sports as a marketing vehicle  But others argue that RB Leipzig is just what the city and surrounding region need  There has been little Bundesliga football in the former East Germany since unification in 1990  Football is a business that needs an enormous amount of money  says Martin Machowecz from weekly newspaper Die Zeit  And here someone who is come along  got involved and made sure that we've now reached the same standard as in West Germany in an area of society that important  What RB as a club lacks in sporting history  its home city and its stadium provide  Lokomotive Leipzig became a household name when they beat Bordeaux in a penalty shoot out to qualify for the final of the Uefa Cup Winners' Cup in 1987  The goalkeeper saved two penalties before stepping up to score the winner  Gerlinde Rohr  now director of the Leipzig Sports Museum  was among the reported 110 000 in the stadium that night  I was there with a school mate and after Rene Mueller scored his goal I jumped on the seat and we embraced each other  she remembers  The Zentralstadion fell into disuse after unification but was given a new lease of life by the 2006 World Cup  The oval embankment of the old stadium was retained and a new stadium built inside it  It is now called the Red Bull Arena  Many see the appointment of Ralf Rangnick as the turning point for RBL  who had spent two frustrating seasons in the fourth tier before his arrival in 2012  As sports director and  for a brief period  trainer  he oversaw three promotions in four seasons  Ralf Rangnick key to success is youth  He likes to buy players who may never previously have had a professional contract and his squad is the youngest in the Bundesliga  with an average age of a little over 23  In his eyes  young players are hungrier for success and fit his playing philosophy  In Leipzig they place huge emphasis on pressing the other team high up the pitch and winning the ball in the opponent half  Even if you are the best player in the world and you are being attacked by three players  you lose the ball  he says  Ralf Rangnick also believes in the club controversial ownership model  What do you need members for  I am more interested in the number of supporters we have  he says  As for suggestions that Red Bull owner Dietrich Mateschitz plays a big role in the way the club is run  the sports director says they meet and speak on the phone a handful of times every year  But what of the complaint that RB Leipzig is merely a vehicle for selling cans of energy drinks  For us it is completely unimportant  he says  It is got nothing to do with what we do ,0,0,1,0,0
107,Not Applicable,A GP practice in Plymouth has reduced the time it takes to get a routine appointment with a doctor from three to four weeks to under seven days  The Beacon Medical Group cares for more than 30 000 patients and was formed in 2014 after three practices merged  Dr Jonathan Cope  GP and managing partner at Plympton Health Centre  one of the Beacon practices which has 10 doctors  says  at present  there are 30 unfilled GP posts in Plymouth  Three years ago  his practice was unable to recruit the equivalent of one and a half full time GPs  We made a conscious decision to look elsewhere  to work differently  So we decided to looks at what skills clinical pharmacists  paramedic practitioners and nurse practitioners could offer  We converted that budget to two and a half full time equivalents  Patients registered at Plympton who feel they need same day care from their family doctor call the reception team at the surgery  Depending on the problem  they will then be called back by an advanced paramedic  pharmacist  nurse practitioner   or a doctor  Dr Cope said: Because of the extra capacity  we have freed up the GPs' time  So we are offering more appointments for routine problems  and the waiting times are now shorter  The advanced paramedic practitioner  Simon Robinson  responds to any emergency medical problems in the practice  as well as doing  on average  four home visits a day  He says he is often called out to see the more complex cases and his daily schedule allows him to spend more time than the GPs with patients  Simon was keen to point out that if he does have any queries he just has to knock on the GPs' door  Prof Helen Stokes Lampard  chair of the Royal College of GPs  said while paramedics are highly valued and trusted  they have different skills and training  GPs are highly trained to take into account the physical  psychological and social factor   this unique skill set cannot be replaced by another healthcare professional  however well meaning the intention is  We do not have enough GPs in the NHS   and actually we do not have enough paramedics either  This transference of workload pressures from one area of the health service to another is not going to benefit our patients in the long term  In an effort to understand the pressures on the Beacon Medical Group  the 100 most frequent attendees were analysed  Dr Cope expected the list to be dominated by frail  elderly patients but instead the typical patient was a 37 year old woman  often with mental health problems  multiple prescriptions and referrals to hospital  From March  a psychiatrist will do a weekly clinic from the surgery for these patients and provide additional training on mental health care to staff  It is part of a parallel drive to offer specialised new services more commonly found in a hospital setting  Dr Helen Frow  a GP with a special interest in dermatology  has provided care to patients registered to the group in the last two years  Onward referrals to the hospital have reduced by 85%  she said  A similar scheme for musculoskeletal care resulted in 75% fewer secondary care appointments  The model of working with between 30 000 to 50 000 patients in a multi specialty community provider model is known as a Primary Care Home  There were 14 other sites working to this structure across England in the last year  The National Association of Primary Care is working closely with NHS England to explore how they can continue to expand working in this way  A BMA spokesperson said: Many GP practices are increasingly becoming hubs where nurses and other professionals work together to deliver services to patients  However  while this is encouraging  England is suffering from a drastic and worsening shortage of GPs that is damaging patient care and restricting the number of appointments on offer to the public  The government needs to address this workforce crisis urgently  A week of coverage by BBC News examining the state of the NHS across the UK as it comes under intense pressure during its busiest time of the year ,0,0,1,0,0
108,Not Applicable,Andrew Foster is the chief executive of Wrightington  Wigan and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust  It is one of the best performing hospital trusts and up until a year ago it was meeting the four hour A&E target  But that began to change in 2016  Instead of hitting the 95% target for patients to be seen and treated or admitted  performance dropped to 90% and then 85% in the autumn  before it nosedived following Christmas  Cubicles in A&E were full  we had ambulance staff queuing in the corridors and we could not get patients out of hospital It started from Boxing Day onwards  says Mr Foster  We had an outbreak of norovirus which closed three wards and led to 75 staff being off sick  Seven care homes had to shut too  It meant our performance dropped to around 60%  It was the worst three weeks I've ever known  Cubicles in A&E were full  we had ambulance staff queuing in the corridors and we could not get patients out of hospital  The whole system backed up  Since mid January pressures have eased with four hour performance back above 80%  But Mr Foster is still worried  The problem we have is that we are seeing more and more patients coming to A&E who could be seen by a GP and then we are finding it more difficult to discharge patients  There are simply not the places available any more because of the cuts to social care or we are seeing care homes and families themselves saying that the person care is too complex  They end up staying in hospital  Simon Walsh is a consultant in an A&E department in a major trauma centre in London  This year things have been closer to breaking point than I've ever known it before  he says  The set of nights I worked in the period before Christmas were the most difficult I remember working in the last 10 years  There was just such pressure on the system and as a result the exit block was so sustained that we had patients stuck for hours on end because there weren't any beds available to admit them on to wards  We had in excess of 20 patients at times for the whole night  And it just paralyses the emergency department  I do not think I've ever seen such tired  exhausted people   they were absolutely dead on their feet He says patients and their families were understanding  even though they were frustrated  The relatives expressed their frustration but it was not anger directed at us   they recognised it was factors out of our control  But he says morale was low among staff  I do not think I've ever seen such tired  exhausted people  they were absolutely dead on their feet  People try and keep each other up with as high morale as they can but I think people in that period were close to breaking point  I wondered if people would actually come back for the next shift after a couple of the nights we did  Kimberley Gardner is a nurse at a major trauma centre in the East Midlands working in the critical care department  while her partner is also a nurse in the emergency department  She says calling the situation in the NHS a humanitarian crisis  as the Red Cross did in January  is not hyperbole  it is the reality  It is the worst I've ever known it  I saw a woman brought in by ambulance after vomiting from eating a tin of Quality Street During the coalition years we heard the term 'black alert' being thrown around  but it would never actually happen  it seemed as likely as a major disaster or terrorist attack   devastating  but highly unlikely  Now it is a weekly and sometimes daily occurrence and the novelty has worn off  Daily we get a phone call from an emergency department begging critical care for equipment to monitor patients as all of their resus bays have been 'doubled up' (where they put two patients in one bay) meaning they need two monitors but only have one  They ask us but we have run out also  She says another issue is not enough trained paramedics or dispatchers for 111  the NHS non emergency phoneline  The amount of people sent in by 111 to be on the safe side  it is a total failure  I saw a woman brought in by ambulance after eating a tin of Quality Street and she was vomiting   why would she ring an ambulance but also why did the crew bring her in  Because a lot of the time they are technicians and not trained paramedics so bring them in to be on the safe side  Julie Orr is the head of clinical services for Milton Keynes University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust  She oversees the flow of patients through the hospital managing the site team  bed managers and discharge team  People do not have time to catch breath before the next onslaught  It is been a challenge this winter  I think the main difference has been that it is been sustained pressure  It is been quite relentless rather than periods of a couple of weeks of pressure  I've been in the NHS for 30 years and this is probably one of the most sustained  relentlessly pressured winters that I've seen  People do not really have time to catch their breath before the next onslaught of pressures  A former nursing manager  she says all her team are senior clinicians and move around the site ensuring the flow of patients through the hospital  We've had some very difficult days  which has meant that not only the site team but the managers on call and the executive on call have been on site for many  many hours into the night to make sure the patients are safe and that the staff are supported  But she says her teams have coped remarkably well despite the pressure  Obviously it is very difficult  We all want to do the best for our patients and want to get them home wherever possible or on to the next stage of their journey   I think sometimes there is not an understanding of why that can not happen  My discharge team along with the ward nursing teams spend a lot of time with patients trying to explain why there might be a delay in that happening  Grainne Siggins is director of adult social care for the London Borough of Newham  Our staff and our staff within the NHS have worked incredibly hard this winter  it is been really difficult  But in December working positively with our colleagues we didn't have any delayed transfers (out of hospital) at all due to social care  She knows from speaking to her local peers within London they are an outlier to be in this situation  Because of the borough diverse population and high levels of deprivation and health issues they bring  the team has had to proactively plan   but she says it is becoming increasingly difficult going forward  It is difficult to see how the system will be sustained She says they have been heavily supported by their clinical commissioning group  Councils are currently prioritising adults and children services above other areas of spending  but that will only go so far and we do feel we are at a tipping point and that been borne out this winter   it is difficult to see how the whole system will be able to be sustained next year  And she says the ageing population means assessments are taking much longer  People have got much more complex needs  multiple long term conditions  so we've got that added level of complexity  We've seen a significant increase in the level of support we then have to provide to people to make sure they can go home safely and that they are appropriately supported  Dr Olivia Hum has been a GP since 2007  She works in a surgery in Lewes  east Sussex  The intensity of the work in 2017 is really bad  We work 10 12 hours a day without a break  she says  GPs are burning out  they are overworked She says the demand on GPs has increased because of the pressure on hospitals  A&E is too crowded which means that people are not diagnosed properly and they come to the GP for the rest of their health problems  They then bounce back to the hospital  The local hospital has seen a huge decline in funding  so people are on six to nine month waiting lists  This has a huge impact on GPs who are dealing with the deteriorating symptoms of people waiting for tests or treatment  including patients who have symptoms of cancer  This waiting also has huge personal impact on patients  it increases their worry and stress  She adds: There is a real crisis in GP staffing  Lots of practices are closing  so patients try to register at the practice next door which has no space  GPs are burning out  they are overworked and many are retiring early  The system is unsustainable now  It is just impossible to provide extra appointments in practices  I know GPs with almost twice as many patients as I have and they can only provide care at a very basic level  It is not safe   the brain can not make these decisions properly in less than 10 minutes  In these cases  quality of care and patient safety is compromised  A week of coverage by BBC News examining the

fall off a cliff  I break down in tears at least once a day  He is had his life taken away too soon  Are we saying that because he is too complicated  our society can not care for him  It seems like such a big fight to just find out from the hospital what is going on  I just hope to God that he does not understand what is happening to him  I feel like he'll never come home again  he seems lost to

out  but apparently they performed three lots of heart massage   90 compressions  When I came round they spoke to me and  although I was scared  the way that the paramedic spoke to me made me feel safe  The ambulance crew were absolutely phenomenal  A friend who is a paramedic came to see me and he told me that the last six heart attack patients he worked on had died   I felt so lucky that I had this particular ambulance crew  They have given me my life back  The paramedic was treating me  teaching a trainee and looking after my wife in the ambulance   I could not have asked for a better

extraordinarily friendly  They are there despite the infrastructure problems in the NHS  and the care could not be better  From the moment I walk in  I know I am being looked after  My only problem is

bed for you ' I was gutted  The kids were so confused when they came home and I was still there  I've been waiting for 15 months now   it is hanging over me  I did not believe the second appointment would happen  but I packed my bags anyway  We didn't even bother to rearrange my husband work that time  if he is not working we are not earning  so we can not afford these cancellations  I put things in place with my work for people to cover me  I am still waiting  hopefully it is third time lucky  When 29 year old Paul was feeling suicidal in January  the NHS crisis care team in west London gave him 24 hour care to keep him safe  He has received treatment for bipolar disorder for four years and says his consultant and crisis team are outstanding  They helped me in my darkest and most depressive hours  says Paul  who asked for his surname not to be revealed  I came back home after New Year and went back to day to day life  but it kicked off a hefty depression and I was left feeling really low and suicidal  My partner called the crisis team  and they came to our house three or four times a day  They come at 02:00 or 03:00  they are really responsive  I do not feel like they are just doing their jobs  they have genuine care for me  They take away my medication to make sure I will not overdose and when they visit  they make me take the medication  Sometimes they just spend time with me  They ask how I am  what did you eat and sometimes they make me do things like go and buy some milk  which I do not always feel able to do  I would not be alive without them  But one problem I have with NHS mental health care is that they medicate but do not do counselling  there is a massive waiting list  so now I have to get counselling privately  I stayed on a chair beside my mum and slept on the floor   she died a week later Before she was diagnosed with cancer  my mum could run a marathon  says Richard Taylor  55 from Liverpool  He was devastated after watching her undignified death last month  The local cancer centre did not have the capacity to give her end of life care  After she received the second diagnosis  she was sent home and we got caught in a communication loop between three hospitals  It was an emotional rollercoaster  Eventually I had to take her to A&E   she could not eat or drink  She spent 13 hours on a trolley  behind a curtain in a noisy and busy ward  I stayed on a chair beside her and slept on the floor   she died a week later  My gripe is with the lack of communication and the delays in my mum treatment  The nursing staff were fantastic  but there is only so much they can do   they could not give my mum 24 hour attention  She was a very proud and dignified woman   but in the end she was simply scared to be alone  It was awful watching someone die in this extremely undignified way  If she was an animal  they would have put her down   she was starving and dehydrated  The nurses were lovely and compassionate  but they offered me no support  The NHS is a great thing  but it is under the hammer  A week of coverage by BBC News examining the state of the NHS across the UK as it comes under intense pressure during

123,"Albert Einstein
","Albert Einstein ( EYEN styne; German: [ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn] (listen); 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German born theoretical physicist  widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest physicists of all time  Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity  but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics  Relativity and quantum mechanics are together the two pillars of modern physics  His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2  which arises from relativity theory  has been dubbed the world most famous equation  His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science  He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his services to theoretical physics  and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect  a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory  His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in Einstein becoming synonymous with genius In 1905  a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ('miracle year')  Einstein published four groundbreaking papers  These outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect  explained Brownian motion  introduced special relativity  and demonstrated mass energy equivalence  Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field  which led him to develop his special theory of relativity  He then extended the theory to gravitational fields; he published a paper on general relativity in 1916  introducing his theory of gravitation  In 1917  he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe  He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory  which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules  He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation  which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light  However  for much of the later part of his career  he worked on two ultimately unsuccessful endeavors  First  despite his great contributions to quantum mechanics  he opposed what it evolved into  objecting that nature does not play dice  Second  he attempted to devise a unified field theory by generalizing his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism  As a result  he became increasingly isolated from the mainstream of modern physics 
Einstein was born in the German Empire  but moved to Switzerland in 1895  forsaking his German citizenship (as a subject of the Kingdom of Württemberg) the following year  In 1897  at the age of 17  he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss Federal polytechnic school in Zürich  graduating in 1900  In 1901 he acquired Swiss citizenship  which he kept for the rest of his life  and in 1903 he secured a permanent position at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern  In 1905  he was awarded a PhD by the University of Zurich  In 1914  Einstein moved to Berlin in order to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Humboldt University of Berlin  In 1917  Einstein became director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics; he also became a German citizen again  this time Prussian 
In 1933  while Einstein was visiting the United States  Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany  Einstein  of Jewish origin  objected to the policies of the newly elected Nazi government; he settled in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940  On the eve of World War II  he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D  Roosevelt alerting him to the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US begin similar research  Einstein supported the Allies but generally denounced the idea of nuclear weapons ",0,0,0,0,1

Henry became actively involved by the age of 14 in the efforts of his mother Matilda  daughter of Henry I of England  to claim the throne of England  then occupied by Stephen of Blois  Stephen agreed to a peace treaty after Henry military expedition to England in 1153  and Henry inherited the kingdom on Stephen death a year later  Henry was an energetic and ruthless ruler  driven by a desire to restore the lands and privileges of his grandfather Henry I  During the early years of his reign the younger Henry restored the royal administration in England  re established hegemony over Wales and gained full control over his lands in Anjou  Maine and Touraine  Henry desire to reform the relationship with the Church led to conflict with his former friend Thomas Becket  the Archbishop of Canterbury  This controversy lasted for much of the 1160s and resulted in Becket murder in 1170  Henry soon came into conflict with Louis VII  and the two rulers fought what has been termed a cold war over several decades  Henry expanded his empire at Louis expense  taking Brittany and pushing east into central France and south into Toulouse; despite numerous peace conferences and treaties  no lasting agreement was reached 
Henry and Eleanor had eight children—three daughters and five sons  Three of his sons would be king  though Henry the Young King was named his father co ruler rather than a stand alone king  As the sons grew up  tensions over the future inheritance of the empire began to emerge  encouraged by Louis and his son King Philip II  In 1173 Henry heir apparent  Young Henry  rebelled in protest; he was joined by his brothers Richard (later king) and Geoffrey and by their mother  Eleanor  France  Scotland  Brittany  Flanders  and Boulogne allied themselves with the rebels  The Great Revolt was only defeated by Henry vigorous military action and talented local commanders  many of them new men appointed for their loyalty and administrative skills  Young Henry and Geoffrey revolted again in 1183  resulting in Young Henry death  The Norman invasion of Ireland provided lands for his youngest son John (later king)  but Henry struggled to find ways to satisfy all his sons' desires for land and immediate power  By 1189  Young Henry and Geoffrey were dead  and Philip successfully played on Richard fears that Henry II would make John king  leading to a final rebellion  Decisively defeated by Philip and Richard and suffering from a bleeding ulcer  Henry retreated to Chinon Castle in Anjou  He died soon afterwards and was succeeded by Richard 
Henry empire quickly collapsed during the reign of his son John (who succeeded Richard  in 1199)  but many of the changes Henry introduced during his long rule had long term consequences  Henry legal changes are generally considered to have laid the basis for the English Common Law  while his intervention in Brittany  Wales  and Scotland shaped the development of their societies and governmental systems  Historical interpretations of Henry reign have changed considerably over time  Contemporary chroniclers such as Gerald of Wales and William of Newburgh  though sometimes unfavorable  generally lauded his achievements  describing him as our Alexander of the West and an excellent and beneficent prince respectively   In the 18th century  scholars argued that Henry was a driving force in the creation of a genuinely English monarchy and  ultimately  a unified Britain with David Hume going so far as to characterize Henry as the greatest prince of his time for wisdom  virtue  and abilities  and the most powerful in extent of dominion of all those who had ever filled the throne of England  During the Victorian expansion of the British Empire  historians were keenly interested in the formation of Henry own empire  but they also expressed concern over his private life and treatment of Becket  Late 20th century historians have combined British and French historical accounts of Henry  challenging earlier Anglocentric interpretations of his reign ",0,0,0,0,1

","Sir Isaac Newton  (25 December 1642 – 20 March 1726/27) was an English mathematician  physicist  astronomer  theologian  and author (described in his time as a natural philosopher) who is widely recognised as one of the greatest mathematicians  physicists  and most influential scientists of all time  He was a key figure in the philosophical revolution known as the Enlightenment  His book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy)  first published in 1687  established classical mechanics  Newton also made seminal contributions to optics  and shares credit with German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing infinitesimal calculus 
In Principia  Newton formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that formed the dominant scientific viewpoint until it was superseded by the theory of relativity  Newton used his mathematical description of gravity to derive Kepler laws of planetary motion  account for tides  the trajectories of comets  the precession of the equinoxes and other phenomena  eradicating doubt about the Solar System heliocentricity  He demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and celestial bodies could be accounted for by the same principles  Newton inference that the Earth is an oblate spheroid was later confirmed by the geodetic measurements of Maupertuis  La Condamine  and others  convincing most European scientists of the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over earlier systems 
Newton built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a sophisticated theory of colour based on the observation that a prism separates white light into the colours of the visible spectrum  His work on light was collected in his highly influential book Opticks  published in 1704  He also formulated an empirical law of cooling  made the first theoretical calculation of the speed of sound  and introduced the notion of a Newtonian fluid  In addition to his work on calculus  as a mathematician Newton contributed to the study of power series  generalised the binomial theorem to non integer exponents  developed a method for approximating the roots of a function  and classified most of the cubic plane curves 
Newton was a fellow of Trinity College and the second Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge  He was a devout but unorthodox Christian who privately rejected the doctrine of the Trinity  Unusually for a member of the Cambridge faculty of the day  he refused to take holy orders in the Church of England  Beyond his work on the mathematical sciences  Newton dedicated much of his time to the study of alchemy and biblical chronology  but most of his work in those areas remained unpublished until long after his death  Politically and personally tied to the Whig party  Newton served two brief terms as Member of Parliament for the University of Cambridge  in 1689–1690 and 1701–1702  He was knighted by Queen Anne in 1705 and spent the last three decades of his life in London  serving as Warden (1696–1699) and Master (1699–1727) of the Royal Mint  as well as president of the Royal Society (1703–1727) ",0,0,0,0,1

Up until 1982  Stallone films were not big box office successes unless they were Rocky sequels  and none received the critical acclaim achieved with the first Rocky  This changed with the successful action film First Blood in which he portrayed the PTSD plagued soldier John Rambo  Originally an adaptation of the eponymous novel by David Morell  First Blood script was significantly altered by Stallone during the film production  Stallone would play the role in a total of five Rambo films (1982–2019)  From the mid 1980s through to the late 1990s  Stallone would go on to  become one of Hollywood highest paid actors of that era by appearing in a slew of commercially successful action films  but generally panned by critics  These include Cobra  Tango and Cash  Cliffhanger  Demolition Man  and The Specialist

","Christopher Columbus (; born between 25 August and 31 October 1451  died 20 May 1506) was an Italian explorer and navigator who completed four voyages across the Atlantic Ocean  opening the way for the widespread European exploration and colonization of the Americas  His expeditions  sponsored by the Catholic Monarchs of Spain  were the first European contact with the Caribbean  Central America  and South America  
The name Christopher Columbus is the Anglicisation of the Latin Christophorus Columbus  Scholars generally agree that Columbus was born in the Republic of Genoa and spoke a dialect of Ligurian as his first language  He went to sea at a young age and travelled widely  as far north as the British Isles and as far south as what is now Ghana  He married Portuguese noblewoman Filipa Moniz Perestrelo and was based in Lisbon for several years  but later took a Castilian mistress; he had one son with each woman  Largely self educated  Columbus was widely read in geography  astronomy  and history  He formulated a plan to seek a western sea passage to the East Indies  hoping to profit from the lucrative spice trade  Following Columbus persistent lobbying to multiple kingdoms  Catholic Monarchs Queen Isabella I and King Ferdinand II agreed to sponsor a journey west  Columbus left Castile in August 1492 with three ships and made landfall in the Americas on 12 October (ending the period of human habitation in the Americas now referred to as the pre Columbian era)  His landing place was an island in the Bahamas  known by its native inhabitants as Guanahani  Columbus subsequently visited the islands now known as Cuba and Hispaniola  establishing a colony in what is now Haiti  Columbus returned to Castile in early 1493  bringing a number of captured natives with him  Word of his voyages soon spread throughout Europe 
Columbus made three further voyages to the Americas  exploring the Lesser Antilles in 1493  Trinidad and the northern coast of South America in 1498  and the eastern coast of Central America in 1502  Many of the names he gave to geographical features—particularly islands—are still in use  He also gave the name indios (Indians) to the indigenous peoples he encountered  The extent to which he was aware that the Americas were a wholly separate landmass is uncertain; he never clearly renounced his belief that he had reached the Far East  As a colonial governor  Columbus was accused by his contemporaries of significant brutality and was soon removed from the post  Columbus strained relationship with the Crown of Castile and its appointed colonial administrators in America led to his arrest and removal from Hispaniola in 1500  and later to protracted litigation over the benefits that he and his heirs claimed were owed to them by the crown  Columbus expeditions inaugurated a period of exploration  conquest  and colonization that lasted for centuries  helping create the modern Western world  The transfers between the Old World and New World that followed his first voyage are known as the Columbian exchange 
Columbus was widely venerated in the centuries after his death  but public perception has fractured in recent decades as scholars have given greater attention to the harms committed under his governance  particularly the beginning of the depopulation of Hispaniola indigenous Taínos from mistreatment and European diseases  as well as their enslavement  Proponents of the Black Legend theory of history claim that Columbus has been unfairly maligned as part of a wider anti Catholic sentiment  Many places in the Western Hemisphere bear his name  including the country of Colombia  the District of Columbia  and British Columbia ",0,0,0,0,1

During his youth  Alexander was tutored by Aristotle until the age of 16  His father Philip was assassinated in 336 BC at the wedding of Cleopatra of Macedon  Alexander sister  and Alexander assumed the throne of the Kingdom of Macedon  After sacking the city of Thebes  Alexander was awarded the generalship of Greece  He used his authority to launch his father pan Hellenic project  which involved him assuming the leadership position to all the Greeks in their conquest of Persia In 334 BC he invaded the Achaemenid Empire (Persian Empire) and began a series of campaigns that lasted 10 years  Following his conquest of Asia Minor (modern day Turkey)  Alexander broke the power of Persia in a series of decisive battles  including those at Issus and Gaugamela  He subsequently overthrew King Darius III and conquered the Achaemenid Empire in its entirety  At that point  his empire stretched from the Adriatic Sea to the Indus River  Alexander endeavored to reach the ends of the world and the Great Outer Sea and invaded India in 326 BC  achieving an important victory over King Porus at the Battle of the Hydaspes  He eventually turned back at the Beas River due to the demand of his homesick troops  dying in Babylon in 323 BC; the city he planned to establish as his capital  He did not manage to execute a series of planned campaigns that would have begun with an invasion of Arabia  In the years following his death  a series of civil wars tore his empire apart 
Alexander legacy includes the cultural diffusion and syncretism which his conquests engendered  such as Greco Buddhism and Hellenistic Judaism  He founded more than twenty cities that bore his name  most notably Alexandria in Egypt  Alexander settlement of Greek colonists and the resulting spread of Greek culture resulted in Hellenistic civilization  which developed through the Roman Empire into modern Western culture  The Greek language became the lingua franca of the region and was the predominant language of the Byzantine Empire up until its end in the mid 15th century AD   Greek speaking communities in central and far eastern Anatolia survived until the Greek genocide and the population exchange in the 1920s  Alexander became legendary as a classical hero in the mould of Achilles  featuring prominently in the history and mythic traditions of both Greek and non Greek cultures  His military achievements and enduring  unprecedented success in battle made him the measure against which many later military leaders would compare themselves  Military academies throughout the world still teach his tactics ",0,0,0,0,1

Born to a poor family in Gori in the Russian Empire (now Georgia)  Stalin attended the Tbilisi Spiritual Seminary before eventually joining the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party  He went on to edit the party newspaper  Pravda  and raised funds for Vladimir Lenin Bolshevik faction via robberies  kidnappings and protection rackets  Repeatedly arrested  he underwent several internal exiles  After the Bolsheviks seized power during the October Revolution and created a one party state under the newly formed Communist Party in 1917  Stalin joined its governing Politburo  Serving in the Russian Civil War before overseeing the Soviet Union establishment in 1922  Stalin assumed leadership over the country following Lenin death in 1924  Under Stalin  socialism in one country became a central tenet of the party dogma  As a result of the Five Year Plans implemented under his leadership  the country underwent agricultural collectivisation and rapid industrialisation  creating a centralised command economy  This led to severe disruptions of food production that contributed to the famine of 1932–33  To eradicate accused enemies of the working class  Stalin instituted the Great Purge  in which over a million were imprisoned and at least 700 000 executed between 1934 and 1939  By 1937  he had absolute control over the party and government 
Stalin promoted Marxism–Leninism abroad through the Communist International and supported European anti fascist movements during the 1930s  particularly in the Spanish Civil War  In 1939  his regime signed a non aggression pact with Nazi Germany  resulting in the Soviet invasion of Poland  Germany ended the pact by invading the Soviet Union in 1941  Despite initial setbacks  the Soviet Red Army repelled the German invasion and captured Berlin in 1945  thereby ending World War II in Europe  Amid the war  the Soviets annexed the Baltic states and then established Soviet aligned governments throughout Central and Eastern Europe  China  and North Korea  The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as global superpowers and entered a period of tensions  the Cold War  Stalin presided over the Soviet post war reconstruction and its development of an atomic bomb in 1949  During these years  the country experienced another major famine and an antisemitic campaign that culminated in the doctors' plot  After Stalin death in 1953  he was eventually succeeded by Nikita Khrushchev  who subsequently denounced his rule and initiated the de Stalinisation of Soviet society 
Widely considered to be one of the 20th century most significant figures  Stalin was the subject of a pervasive personality cult within the international Marxist–Leninist movement  which revered him as a champion of the working class and socialism  Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991  Stalin has retained popularity in Russia and Georgia as a victorious wartime leader who cemented the Soviet Union status as a leading world power  Conversely  his regime has been described as totalitarian  and has been widely condemned for overseeing mass repression  ethnic cleansing  wide scale deportation  hundreds of thousands of executions  and famines that killed millions ",0,0,0,0,1

In founding psychoanalysis  Freud developed therapeutic techniques such as the use of free association and discovered transference  establishing its central role in the analytic process  Freud redefinition of sexuality to include its infantile forms led him to formulate the Oedipus complex as the central tenet of psychoanalytical theory  His analysis of dreams as wish fulfillments provided him with models for the clinical analysis of symptom formation and the underlying mechanisms of repression  On this basis  Freud elaborated his theory of the unconscious and went on to develop a model of psychic structure comprising id  ego and super ego  Freud postulated the existence of libido  sexualised energy with which mental processes and structures are invested and which generates erotic attachments  and a death drive  the source of compulsive repetition  hate  aggression  and neurotic guilt  In his later works  Freud developed a wide ranging interpretation and critique of religion and culture 
Though in overall decline as a diagnostic and clinical practice  psychoanalysis remains influential within psychology  psychiatry  and psychotherapy  and across the humanities  It thus continues to generate extensive and highly contested debate concerning its therapeutic efficacy  its scientific status  and whether it advances or hinders the feminist cause  Nonetheless  Freud work has suffused contemporary Western thought and popular culture  W  H  Auden 1940 poetic tribute to Freud describes him as having created a whole climate of opinion / under whom we conduct our different lives ",0,0,0,0,1

","Ludwig van Beethoven ( (listen)  German: [ˈluːtvɪç fan ˈbeːtˌhoːfn̩] (listen); baptised 17 December 1770 – 26 March 1827) was a German composer and pianist  Beethoven remains one of the most admired composers in the history of Western music; his works rank amongst the most performed of the classical music repertoire and span the transition from the Classical period to the Romantic era in classical music  His career has conventionally been divided into early  middle  and late periods  The early period  during which he forged his craft  is typically considered to have lasted until 1802  From 1802 to around 1812  his middle period showed an individual development from the classical styles of Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart  and is sometimes characterized as heroic  During this time  he began to suffer increasingly from deafness  In his late period from 1812 to his death in 1827  he extended his innovations in musical form and expression 
Born in Bonn  Beethoven musical talent was obvious at an early age  and he was initially harshly and intensively taught by his father Johann van Beethoven  Beethoven was later taught by the composer and conductor Christian Gottlob Neefe  under whose tutelage he published his first work  a set of keyboard variations  in 1783  He found relief from a dysfunctional home life with the family of Helene von Breuning  whose children he loved  befriended  and taught piano  At age 21  he moved to Vienna  which subsequently became his base  and studied composition with Haydn  Beethoven then gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist  and he was soon patronized by Karl Alois  Prince Lichnowsky for compositions  which resulted in his three Opus 1 piano trios (the earliest works to which he accorded an opus number) in 1795 
His first major orchestral work  the First Symphony  premiered in 1800  and his first set of string quartets was published in 1801  Despite his hearing deteriorating during this period  he continued to conduct  premiering his Third and Fifth Symphonies in 1804 and 1808  respectively  His Violin Concerto appeared in 1806  His last piano concerto (No  5  Op  73  known as the 'Emperor')  dedicated to his frequent patron Archduke Rudolf of Austria  was premiered in 1811  without Beethoven as soloist  He was almost completely deaf by 1814  and he then gave up performing and appearing in public  He described his problems with health and his unfulfilled personal life in two letters  his Heiligenstadt Testament (1802) to his brothers and his unsent love letter to an unknown Immortal Beloved (1812) 
After 1810  increasingly less socially involved  Beethoven composed many of his most admired works  including later symphonies  mature chamber music and the late piano sonatas  His only opera  Fidelio  first performed in 1805  was revised to its final version in 1814  He composed Missa solemnis between 1819 and 1823 and his final Symphony  No  9  one of the first examples of a choral symphony  between 1822 and 1824  Written in his last years  his late string quartets  including the Grosse Fuge  of 1825–1826 are among his final achievements  After some months of bedridden illness  he died in 1827  Beethoven works remain mainstays of the classical music repertoire ",0,0,0,0,1

Aristotle influence on logic continued well into the 19th century  In addition  his ethics  though always influential  gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics 
Aristotle has been called the father of logic  the father of biology  the father of political science  the father of zoology  the father of embryology  the father of natural law  the father of scientific method  the father of rhetoric  the father of psychology  the father of realism  the father of criticism  the father of individualism  the father of teleology  and the father of meteorology ",0,0,0,0,1

Born into an upper middle class family  Van Gogh drew as a child and was serious  quiet  and thoughtful  As a young man  he worked as an art dealer  often traveling  but became depressed after he was transferred to London  He turned to religion and spent time as a Protestant missionary in southern Belgium  He drifted in ill health and solitude before taking up painting in 1881  having moved back home with his parents  His younger brother Theo supported him financially; the two kept a long correspondence by letter  His early works  mostly still lifes and depictions of peasant labourers  contain few signs of the vivid colour that distinguished his later work  In 1886  he moved to Paris  where he met members of the avant garde  including Émile Bernard and Paul Gauguin  who were reacting against the Impressionist sensibility  As his work developed he created a new approach to still lifes and local landscapes  His paintings grew brighter as he developed a style that became fully realised during his stay in Arles in the South of France in 1888  During this period he broadened his subject matter to include series of olive trees  wheat fields and sunflowers 
Van Gogh suffered from psychotic episodes and delusions and though he worried about his mental stability  he often neglected his physical health  did not eat properly and drank heavily  His friendship with Gauguin ended after a confrontation with a razor when  in a rage  he severed part of his own left ear  He spent time in psychiatric hospitals  including a period at Saint Rémy  After he discharged himself and moved to the Auberge Ravoux in Auvers sur Oise near Paris  he came under the care of the homeopathic doctor Paul Gachet  His depression persisted  and on 27 July 1890  Van Gogh is believed to have shot himself in the chest with a revolver  dying from his injuries two days later 
Van Gogh was commercially unsuccessful during his lifetime  and he was considered a madman and a failure  As he only became famous after his suicide  he came to be seen as a misunderstood genius in the public imagination  His reputation grew in the early 20th century as elements of his style came to be incorporated by the Fauves and German Expressionists  He attained widespread critical and commercial success over the ensuing decades  and is remembered as an important but tragic painter whose troubled personality typifies the romantic ideal of the tortured artist  Today  Van Gogh works are among the world most expensive paintings to have ever sold  and his legacy is honoured by a museum in his name  the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam  which holds the world largest collection of his paintings and drawings ",0,0,0,0,1

Born in Salzburg  in the Holy Roman Empire  Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood  Already competent on keyboard and violin  he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty  embarking on a grand tour  At 17  Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court but grew restless and travelled in search of a better position 
While visiting Vienna in 1781  he was dismissed from his Salzburg position  He chose to stay in Vienna  where he achieved fame but little financial security  During his final years in Vienna  he composed many of his best known symphonies  concertos  and operas  and portions of the Requiem  which was largely unfinished at the time of his early death at the age of 35  The circumstances of his death are largely uncertain  and have thus been much mythologized 
Despite his short life  his rapid pace of composition resulted in more than 600 works of virtually every genre of his time  Many of these compositions are acknowledged as pinnacles of the symphonic  concertante  chamber  operatic  and choral repertoire  He is considered among the greatest classical composers of all time  and his influence on Western music is profound  particularly on Ludwig van Beethoven  His elder colleague Joseph Haydn wrote: posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years ",0,0,0,0,1

Given its military pre eminence  Sparta was recognized as the leading force of the unified Greek military during the Greco Persian Wars  in rivalry with the rising naval power of Athens  Sparta was the principal enemy of Athens during the Peloponnesian War (between 431 and 404 BCE)  from which it emerged victorious after the Battle of Aegospotami  The decisive Battle of Leuctra in 371 BCE ended the Spartan hegemony  although the city state maintained its political independence until the Roman conquest of Greece in 146 BCE  After the division of the Roman Empire  Sparta underwent a long period of decline  especially in the Middle Ages  when many of its citizens moved to Mystras  Modern Sparta is the capital of the southern Greek region of Laconia and a center for processing citrus and olives 
Sparta was unique in ancient Greece for its social system and constitution  which were supposedly introduced by the semi mythical legislator Lycurgus  His laws configured the Spartan society to maximize military proficiency at all costs  focusing all social institutions on military training and physical development  The inhabitants of Sparta were stratified as Spartiates (citizens with full rights)  mothakes (free non Spartiate people descended from Spartans)  perioikoi (free non Spartiates)  and helots (state owned enslaved non Spartan locals)  Spartiate men underwent the rigorous agoge training regimen  and Spartan phalanx brigades were widely considered to be among the best in battle  Spartan women enjoyed considerably more rights than elsewhere in classical antiquity 

Sparta was frequently a subject of fascination in its own day  as well as in Western culture following the revival of classical learning  The admiration of Sparta is known as Laconophilia  Bertrand Russell wrote:Sparta had a double effect on Greek thought: through the reality  and through the myth     The reality enabled the Spartans to defeat Athens in war; the myth influenced Plato political theory  and that of countless subsequent writers     [The] ideals that it favors had a great part in framing the doctrines of Rousseau  Nietzsche  and National Socialism ",0,0,0,0,1

Of the different words or rather sounds that are used in cheering  hurrah  though now generally looked on as the typical British form of cheer  is found in various forms in German  Scandinavian  Russian (ura)  French (hourra)  It is probably onomatopoeic in origin  The English hurrah was preceded by huzza  stated to be a sailors word  and generally connected with heeze  to hoist  probably being one of the cries that sailors use when hauling or hoisting  The German hoch  seen in full in Hoch lebe der Kaiser  &c   the French vive  Italian and Spanish viva  evviva  are cries rather of acclamation than encouragement  The Japanese shout banzai became familiar during the Russo Japanese War  In reports of parliamentary and other debates the insertion of cheers at any point in a speech indicates that approval was shown by members of the House by emphatic utterances of hear hear  Cheering may be tumultuous  or it may be conducted rhythmically by prearrangement  as in the case of the Hip hip hip by way of introduction to a simultaneous hurrah  The saying hip hip hurrah dates to the early 1800s   Nevertheless  some sources speculate possible roots going back to the crusaders  then meaning Jerusalem is lost to the infidel  and we are on our way to paradise  The abbreviation HEP would then stand for Hierosolyma est perdita  Jerusalem is lost in Latin ",0,0,0,0,1
254,"Charles Dickens
","Charles John Huffam Dickens  (; 7 February 1812 – 9 June 1870) was an English writer and social critic  He created some of the world best known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era  His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime and  by the 20th century  critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius  His novels and short stories are widely read today Born in Portsmouth  Dickens left school at the age of 12 to work in a factory when his father was incarcerated in a debtors' prison  Despite his lack of formal education  he wrote for his local paper for 20 years  wrote 15 novels  five novellas  hundreds of short stories and non fiction articles  lectured and performed readings extensively  was an indefatigable letter writer  and campaigned vigorously for children rights  education and other social reforms 
Dickens literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of The Pickwick Papers  a publishing phenomenon—thanks largely to the introduction of the character Sam Weller in the fourth episode—that sparked Pickwick merchandise and spin offs  Within a few years Dickens had become an international literary celebrity  famous for his humour  satire and keen observation of character and society  His novels  most of them published in monthly or weekly instalments  pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction  which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication  Cliffhanger endings in his serial publications kept readers in suspense  The instalment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audience reaction  and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback  For example  when his wife chiropodist expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in David Copperfield seemed to reflect her disabilities  Dickens improved the character with positive features  His plots were carefully constructed and he often wove elements from topical events into his narratives  Masses of the illiterate poor would individually pay a halfpenny to have each new monthly episode read to them  opening up and inspiring a new class of readers His 1843 novella A Christmas Carol remains especially popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every artistic genre  Oliver Twist and Great Expectations are also frequently adapted and  like many of his novels  evoke images of early Victorian London  His 1859 novel A Tale of Two Cities (set in London and Paris) is his best known work of historical fiction  The most famous celebrity of his era  he undertook  in response to public demand  a series of public reading tours in the later part of his career The term Dickensian is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings  such as poor social or working conditions  or comically repulsive characters ",0,0,0,0,1

256,"Jack the Ripper
","Jack the Ripper was an unidentified serial killer active in the largely impoverished areas in and around the Whitechapel district of London in 1888  In both the criminal case files and contemporary journalistic accounts  the killer was called the Whitechapel Murderer and Leather Apron 
Attacks ascribed to Jack the Ripper typically involved female prostitutes who lived and worked in the slums of the East End of London  Their throats were cut prior to abdominal mutilations  The removal of internal organs from at least three of the victims led to proposals that their killer had some anatomical or surgical knowledge  Rumours that the murders were connected intensified in September and October 1888  and numerous letters were received by media outlets and Scotland Yard from individuals purporting to be the murderer  The name Jack the Ripper originated in a letter written by an individual claiming to be the murderer that was disseminated in the media  The letter is widely believed to have been a hoax and may have been written by journalists in an attempt to heighten interest in the story and increase their newspapers' circulation  The From Hell letter received by George Lusk of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee came with half of a preserved human kidney  purportedly taken from one of the victims  The public came increasingly to believe in a single serial killer known as Jack the Ripper  mainly because of both the extraordinarily brutal nature of the murders and media coverage of the crimes 
Extensive newspaper coverage bestowed widespread and enduring international notoriety on the Ripper  and the legend solidified  A police investigation into a series of eleven brutal murders committed in Whitechapel and Spitalfields between 1888 and 1891 was unable to connect all the killings conclusively to the murders of 1888  Five victims—Mary Ann Nichols  Annie Chapman  Elizabeth Stride  Catherine Eddowes  and Mary Jane Kelly—are known as the canonical five and their murders between 31 August and 9 November 1888 are often considered the most likely to be linked  The murders were never solved  and the legends surrounding these crimes became a combination of historical research  folklore  and pseudohistory  capturing public imagination to the present day ",0,0,0,0,1

258,"Anne Boleyn
","Anne Boleyn (; c  1501 – 19 May 1536) was Queen of England from 1533 to 1536  as the second wife of King Henry VIII  The circumstances of her marriage and of her execution by beheading for treason and other charges made her a key figure in the political and religious upheaval that marked the start of the English Reformation  Anne was the daughter of Thomas Boleyn  1st Earl of Wiltshire  and his wife  Lady Elizabeth Howard  and was educated in the Netherlands and France  largely as a maid of honour to Queen Claude of France  Anne returned to England in early 1522  to marry her Irish cousin James Butler  9th Earl of Ormond; the marriage plans were broken off  and instead she secured a post at court as maid of honour to Henry VIII wife  Catherine of Aragon 
Early in 1523  Anne was secretly betrothed to Henry Percy  son of Henry Percy  5th Earl of Northumberland  but the betrothal was broken off when the Earl refused to support their engagement  Cardinal Thomas Wolsey refused the match in January 1524 and Anne was sent home to Hever Castle  In February or March 1526  Henry VIII began his pursuit of Anne  She resisted his attempts to seduce her  refusing to become his mistress  as her sister Mary had previously been  Henry soon focused his desires on annulling his marriage to Catherine so he would be free to marry Anne  Wolsey failed to obtain an annulment of Henry marriage from Pope Clement VII and  in 1529–30  Anne helped bring about his downfall and his death  When it became clear that Clement would not annul the marriage  Henry and his advisers  such as Thomas Cromwell  began the breaking of the Catholic Church power in England and closing the monasteries and the nunneries  In 1532  Henry made Anne the Marquess of Pembroke 
Henry and Anne formally married on 25 January 1533  after a secret wedding on 14 November 1532  On 23 May 1533  the newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer declared Henry and Catherine marriage null and void; five days later  he declared Henry and Anne marriage valid  Shortly afterwards  Clement excommunicated Henry and Cranmer  As a result of this marriage and these excommunications  the first break between the Church of England and Rome took place  and the king took control of the Church of England  Anne was crowned Queen of England on 1 June 1533  On 7 September  she gave birth to the future Queen Elizabeth I  Henry was disappointed to have a daughter rather than a son but hoped a son would follow and professed to love Elizabeth  Anne subsequently had three miscarriages and by March 1536  Henry was courting Jane Seymour  In order to marry Seymour  Henry had to find reasons to end the marriage to Anne 
Henry VIII had Anne investigated for high treason in April 1536  On 2 May  she was arrested and sent to the Tower of London  where she was tried before a jury of peers  including Henry Percy  her former betrothed  and her uncle Thomas Howard  3rd Duke of Norfolk; she was convicted on 15 May and beheaded four days later  Modern historians view the charges against her  which included adultery  incest and plotting to kill the king  as unconvincing After her daughter  Elizabeth  was crowned as Queen in 1558  Anne became venerated as a martyr and heroine of the English Reformation  particularly through the written works of John Foxe  She has inspired  or been mentioned in  many artistic and cultural works and retained her hold on the popular imagination  She has been called the most influential and important queen consort England has ever had  as she provided the occasion for Henry VIII to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon and declare the English church independence from the Vatican ",0,0,0,0,1
259,A Clockwork Orange, Alex  a teenager living in near future England  leads his gang on nightly orgies of opportunistic  random ultra violence  Alex friends (droogs in the novel Anglo Russian slang  Nadsat) are: Dim  a slow witted bruiser who is the gang muscle; Georgie  an ambitious second in command; and Pete  who mostly plays along as the droogs indulge their taste for ultra violence  Characterized as a sociopath and a hardened juvenile delinquent  Alex is also intelligent and quick witted  with sophisticated taste in music  being particularly fond of Beethoven  or Lovely Ludwig Van  The novel begins with the droogs sitting in their favorite hangout (the Korova Milkbar)  drinking milk drug cocktails  called milk plus  to hype themselves for the night mayhem  They assault a scholar walking home from the public library  rob a store leaving the owner and his wife bloodied and unconscious  stomp a panhandling derelict  then scuffle with a rival gang  Joyriding through the

Dim for some crude behaviour  and strains within the gang become apparent  At home in his dreary flat  Alex plays classical music at top volume while fantasizing of even more orgiastic violence  Alex skips school the next day  Following an unexpected visit from P R  Deltoid  his post corrective advisor  Alex meets a pair of ten year old girls and takes them back to his parents' flat  where he

troublesome cellmate to death  he agrees to undergo an experimental behaviour modification treatment called the Ludovico Technique  The technique is a form of aversion therapy in which Alex receives an injection that makes him feel sick while watching graphically violent films  eventually conditioning him to suffer crippling bouts of nausea at the mere thought of violence  As an unintended consequence  the soundtrack to one of the films‚ÄîBeethoven Fifth Symphony‚Äîrenders Alex unable to listen to his beloved classical music  The effectiveness of the technique is demonstrated to a group of VIPs  who watch as Alex collapses before a walloping bully  and abases himself before a scantily clad young woman whose presence has aroused his predatory sexual inclinations  Though the prison chaplain accuses the state of stripping Alex of free will  the government officials on the scene are pleased with the results and Alex is released into society  Since his parents are now renting his room to a lodger  Alex wanders the streets and enters a public library where he hopes to learn a painless way to commit suicide  There  he accidentally encounters the old scholar he assaulted earlier

conditioning  During this sequence  it is revealed that Mrs  Alexander died from the injuries inflicted during the gang rape  and her husband has decided to continue living where her fragrant memory

Alex is offered a well paying job if he agrees to side with the government  As photographers snap pictures  Alex daydreams of orgiastic violence and realizes the Ludovico conditioning has been reversed: I was cured all right  In the final chapter  Alex has a new trio of droogs  but he finds he is beginning to outgrow his taste for violence  A chance encounter with Pete  now married and settled down  inspires Alex to seek a wife and family of his own  He contemplates the likelihood of his future son being a delinquent as he was  a prospect Alex views fatalistically ,1,0,0,0,0

266,Dracula, The novel is told in epistolary format  as a series of letters  diary entries  ships' log entries  and so forth  The main writers of these items are also the novel protagonists  The story is occasionally supplemented with newspaper clippings that relate events not directly witnessed by the story characters  The tale begins with Jonathan Harker  a newly qualified English solicitor  journeying by train and carriage from England to Count Dracula crumbling  remote castle (situated in the Carpathian Mountains on the border of Transylvania  Bukovina and Moldavia)  The purpose of his mission is to provide legal support to Dracula for a real estate transaction overseen by Harker employer  Peter Hawkins  of Exeter in England  At first enticed by Dracula gracious manner  Harker soon discovers that he has become a prisoner in the castle  He also begins to see disquieting facets of Dracula nocturnal life  One night while searching for a way out of the castle  and against Dracula strict admonition not to venture outside his room at night  Harker falls under the spell of three wanton female vampires  the Sisters  He is saved at the last second by the Count  because he wants to keep Harker alive just long enough to obtain needed legal advice and teachings about England and London (Dracula planned travel destination was to be among the teeming millions)  Harker barely escapes from the castle with his life  Not long afterward  a Russian ship  the Demeter  having weighed anchor at Varna  runs aground on the shores of Whitby  England  during a fierce tempest  All of the crew are missing and presumed dead  and only one body is found  that of the captain tied to the ship helm  The captain log is recovered and tells of strange events that had taken place during the ship journey  These events led to the gradual disappearance of the entire crew apparently owing to a malevolent presence on board the ill fated ship  An animal described as a large dog is seen on the ship leaping ashore  The ship cargo is described as silver sand and boxes of mould  or earth  from Transylvania  Soon Dracula is tracking Harker devoted fianc√©e  Wilhelmina Mina Murray  and her friend  Lucy Westenra  Lucy receives three marriage proposals in one day  from Dr  John Seward; Quincey Morris; and the Hon  Arthur Holmwood (later Lord Godalming)  Lucy accepts Holmwood proposal while turning down Seward and Morris  but all remain friends  There is a notable encounter between Dracula and Seward patient Renfield  an insane man who means to consume insects  spiders  birds  and other creatures &mdash; in ascending order of size &mdash; in order to absorb their life force  Renfield acts as a motion sensor  detecting Dracula proximity and supplying clues accordingly  Lucy begins to waste away suspiciously  All of her suitors fret  and Seward calls in his old teacher  Professor Abraham Van Helsing from Amsterdam  Van Helsing immediately determines the cause of Lucy condition but refuses to disclose it  knowing that Seward faith in him will be shaken if he starts to speak of vampires  Van Helsing tries multiple blood transfusions  but they are clearly losing ground  On a night when Van Helsing must return to Amsterdam (and his message to Seward asking him to watch the Westenra household is delayed)  Lucy and her mother are attacked by a wolf  Mrs  Westenra  who has a heart condition  dies of fright  and Lucy apparently dies soon after  Lucy is buried  but soon afterward the newspapers report children being stalked in the night by a bloofer lady (as they describe it)  i e  beautiful lady  Van Helsing  knowing that this means Lucy has become a vampire  confides in Seward  Lord Godalming and Morris  The suitors and Van Helsing track her down  and after a disturbing confrontation between her vampiric self and Arthur  they stake her heart  behead her  and fill her mouth with garlic  Around the same time  Jonathan Harker arrives home from recuperation in Budapest (where Mina joined and married him after his escape from the castle); he and Mina also join the coalition  who turn their attentions to dealing with Dracula  After Dracula learns of Van Helsing and the others' plot against him  he takes revenge by visiting ‚Äì and feeding from ‚Äì Mina at least three times  Dracula also feeds Mina his blood  creating a spiritual bond between them to control her  The only way to forestall this is to kill Dracula first  Mina slowly succumbs to the blood of the vampire that flows through her veins  switching back and forth from a state of consciousness to a state of semi trance during which she is telepathically connected with Dracula  This telepathic connection is established to be two way  in that the Count can influence Mina  but in doing so betrays to her awareness of his surroundings  After the group sterilizes all of his lairs in London by putting pieces of consecrated host in each box of earth  Dracula flees back to his castle in Transylvania  transported in a box with transfer and portage instructions forwarded  pursued by Van Helsing group  who themselves are aided by Van Helsing hypnotizing Mina and questioning her about the Count  The group splits in three directions  Van Helsing goes to the Count castle and kills his trio of brides  and shortly afterwards all converge on the Count just at sundown under the shadow of the castle  Harker and Quincey rush to Dracula box  which is being transported by Gypsies  Harker shears Dracula through the throat with a Kukri while the mortally wounded Quincey  slashed by one of the crew  stabs the Count in the heart with a Bowie knife  Dracula crumbles to dust  and Mina is freed from his curse  The book closes with a note about Mina and Jonathan married life and the birth of their first born son  whom they name after all four members of the party  but refer to only as Quincey in remembrance of their American friend ,1,0,0,0,0
267,Dune Messiah,Twelve years after the events described in Dune (1965)  Paul Muad'Dib Atreides rules as Emperor  By accepting the role of messiah to the Fremen  Paul had unleashed a jihad which conquered most of the known universe  While Paul is the most powerful Emperor ever known  he is powerless to stop the lethal excesses of the religious juggernaut he has created  Although sixty one billion people have perished  Paul prescient visions indicate that this is far from the worst possible outcome for humanity  Motivated by this knowledge  Paul hopes to set humanity on a course that will not inevitably lead to stagnation and destruction  while at the same time acting as ruler of the Empire and focal point of the Fremen religion  The Bene Gesserit  Spacing Guild and Tleilaxu enter into a conspiracy to dethrone Paul  the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam enlisting Paul own consort Princess Irulan  daughter of the deposed Padishah Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV  Paul has refused to father a child with Irulan (or even touch her)  but his Fremen concubine Chani has also failed to produce an heir  causing tension within his monarchy  Desperate both to secure her place in the Atreides dynasty and to preserve the Atreides bloodline for the Bene Gesserit breeding program  Irulan has secretly been giving contraceptives to Chani  Paul is aware of this fact  but has foreseen that the birth of his heir will bring Chani death  and does not want to lose her  Because of the way oracles interfere with one another prescience  the Guild Navigator Edric is able to shield the conspiracy from Paul visions of the future  The Tleilaxu Face Dancer Scytale gives Paul a gift he cannot resist: a Tleilaxu grown ghola of the deceased Duncan Idaho  Paul childhood teacher and friend  now called Hayt  The conspirators hope the presence of Hayt will undermine Paul ability to rule by forcing Paul to question himself and the empire he has created  Furthermore  Paul acceptance of the gift weakens his support among the Fremen  who see the Tleilaxu and their tools as unclean  Chani  taking matters into her own hands  switches to a traditional Fremen fertility diet  preventing Irulan from being able to tamper with her food  and soon becomes pregnant  Otheym  one of Paul former Fedaykin death commandos  reveals evidence of a Fremen conspiracy against Paul  Otheym gives Paul his dwarf Tleilaxu servant Bijaz who  like a recording machine  can remember faces  names  and details  Paul accepts reluctantly  seeing the strands of a Tleilaxu plot  As Paul soldiers attack the conspirators  others set off an atomic weapon called a stone burner  purchased from the Tleilaxu  that destroys the area and blinds Paul  By tradition  all blind Fremen are abandoned in the desert  but Paul shocks the Fremen and entrenches his godhead by proving he can still see  even without eyes  His oracular powers have become so developed that he can foresee in his mind everything that happens  as though his eyes still function  By moving through his life in lockstep with his visions  he can see even the slightest details of the world around him  The disadvantage of this is his inability to change any part of his destiny so long as he wishes to appear sighted  The unraveling of the Fremen conspiracy reveals that Korba  a former Fedaykin and now high priest of Paul church  is among Paul enemies  Hayt interrogates Bijaz  but the little man‚Äîactually an agent of the Tleilaxu‚Äîuses a specific humming intonation that renders Hayt open to implanted commands  Bijaz programs Hayt to offer Paul a bargain when Chani dies: Chani rebirth as a ghola  and the hope that Duncan Idaho memories might be reawakened  in return for Paul sacrificing the throne and going into exile  Bijaz also implants a compulsion that will force Hayt to attempt to kill Paul  given the appropriate circumstances  Hayt remains oblivious of the programming  Eventually news is brought that Chani has died giving birth  Paul reaction to it triggers the compulsions in the mind of Hayt  who attempts to kill Paul  But rather than kill his beloved Paul  Duncan ghola body reacts against its own programming and recovers Duncan full consciousness  He remains conscious of the Zen Sunni and Mentat training given to Hayt by the Tleilaxu  but is no longer bound to their programming  Paul and Chani newborn twins are pre born  like Paul sister Alia had been  and come into the world fully conscious with Kwisatz Haderach like access to ancestral memories thanks to a combination of their genes and an in utero exposure to the quantities of spice in Chani special pregnancy diet  Scytale offers to revive Chani as a ghola in return for all of Paul CHOAM holdings  Paul refuses to submit to the possibility that the Tleilaxu might program Chani in some diabolical way  and Scytale threatens the infants with a knife while he negotiates with Alia  Paul has now been rendered completely blind by the presence of his oracular son  yet he is able to kill Scytale with an accurately aimed dagger thanks to a vision from his son perspective  Now prophetically as well as physically blind  Paul chooses to embrace the Fremen tradition of a blind man walking alone into the desert  winning the fealty of the Fremen for his children  who will inherit his mantle of Emperor  Paul leaves Alia  now romantically involved with Duncan  as regent for the twins  whom he has named Leto and Ghanima  Duncan notes the irony that Paul and Chani deaths had enabled them to triumph against their enemies  and that Paul has escaped deification by walking into the desert as a man  while guaranteeing Fremen support for the Atreides line ,1,0,0,0,0

sending Grete to the conservatorium to pursue violin lessons  something that everyone else including Grete considered to be a dream  Gregor was however pretty determined to do so on the same Christmas

in Grete  grow bored with her performance  but Gregor is transfixed by it  One of the boarders spots Gregor and they become alarmed  Gregor‚Äôs father tries to shove the boarders back into their rooms  but the three men protest and announce that they will move out immediately without paying rent because of the disgusting conditions in the apartment  Grete  who has by now become tired of taking care of Gregor and is realizing the amount of burden his existence puts on each one in the family  tells her parents that they must get rid of Gregor or they will all be ruined  Her father agrees  wishing Gregor could understand them and would leave of his own accord  Gregor does in fact understand and slowly moves back to the bedroom  There  determined to rid his family of his presence  Gregor dies

269,Fahrenheit 451,On a rainy night while returning from his job  Guy Montag is followed by a cheery  17 year old girl named Clarisse McClellan  Clarisse initially bothers Montag with her incessant questions (and Clarisse is a bit bothered by Montag uncalled for reactions  such as laughing when she hasn't said anything funny)  but Montag chooses to tolerate her as she tells him of how she loves nature and walking around and observing how crazy the world has become  The two walk until they reach Clarisse house (which is next to Montag)  Before Clarisse goes inside  she asks Montag if he is happy  The question catches Montag by surprise and he mulls over his encounter with Clarisse (and how similar it was to another encounter in the park involving an English professor who was afraid of Montag)  Montag enters his bedroom  and finds Mildred in bed with her Seashell ear radio in her ear  staring vacantly at the ceiling (just as she is been doing for the past ten years or so)  Montag does not notice anything wrong until his foot hits Mildred empty sleeping pill bottle  Montag tries to wake up his wife  but she does not respond  Montag calls for medical attention  trying to shout over the screams of the passing jet engines above the house  Because accidental prescription pill overdoses have become commonplace  the medical department sends over two cynical  uncaring technicians who use a Black Cobra stomach pump to flush the poisons out of Mildred system and replace her blood with a fresh  mechanical replacement  Montag stands outside Clarisse house and sees that she and her family are the only ones in the neighborhood with the lights on and engaging in a spirited conversation  Montag returns to his house  sees that Mildred is looking slightly better than before  and goes to bed  The next day  Montag finds Mildred in the kitchen  making breakfast and complaining of an upset stomach  Montag tries to tell his wife that she overdosed  but is interrupted by Mildred ramblings of her stomach hurting  but being hungry  and rationalizes that the feeling is from drinking too much alcohol during a party  As Montag leaves for work  he finally tells Mildred (who is watching an interactive soap opera on the parlor walls    three enormous  floor to ceiling television screens) that she overdosed on sleeping pills  Mildred denies that she would do something that suicidal  but Montag insists  Mildred brushes off the issue and returns to her soap opera  Over the next few days  Montag bonds with Clarisse  who tells him that her interest in intellectual activities has made her an outcast in a society dominated by shallow entertainment  and for that  she has no friends and has to see a psychiatrist  On the final day  however  Clarisse does not appear alongside Montag  Montag waits for her  but the wait is short lived when the train comes to take him to work  A few days later  the firemen are called in to burn down the house of an old woman who has been hoarding books  The firemen go to arrest her  but instead the woman recites a quote from Nicholas Ridley and refuses to leave  As the firemen toss the books from the woman upstairs bedroom down to the living room floor and spray the pile with kerosene  Montag accidentally reads a line in one of her books and hides it away before any of his coworkers can see  The woman is given a final warning to leave the house  but the woman produces a match  Before she can strike it  the firemen flee  save for Montag  who watches as the woman lights the match  drops it in the kerosene  and is engulfed in flames  Montag comes home from the jarring experience and tries to take his mind off the event by asking a half asleep Mildred where the two first met and when  Mildred tries to remember  but can not  laughing it off as she heads to the bathroom to take her sleeping pills  As Montag reflects on his stagnant  stilted marriage to Mildred (and how Mildred has become emotionally and mentally dead from watching her parlor wall entertainment  driving recklessly  and her sleeping pill addiction)  Montag begins to cry after realizing that if Mildred died  he wouldn't miss her at all  Montag then asks Mildred about Clarisse and her whereabouts  Mildred initially denies knowledge of what happened to Clarisse  then tells Montag exactly what happened to her: Clarisse was run over by a speeding car and  once her family heard the news about her death  they packed up and moved away  all of which happened four days ago  Montag is shocked that Mildred didn't tell him the grim news sooner and more disturbed over Mildred apathy over the death of someone Montag had genuinely liked  Montag wakes up physically ill and begs Mildred to call in sick for him  Mildred refuses and does not believe that Montag is really sick (even when Montag vomits on the rug from the stench of kerosene    which earlier was like a perfume to him    Mildred is only concerned about whether or not the vomit stain will come out in the wash)  Captain Beatty  Montag fire chief  personally visits him and tells him the story of how books lost their value and where the firemen fit in: Over the course of several decades (with the starting point being after the American Civil War)  populations grew and people embraced new media  sports  and a quickening pace of life  Books were ruthlessly abridged and degraded to accommodate a shorter attention span  Later  minorities and other special interest groups began criticizing books for their controversial content while other critics bashed authors for making people feel inferior by publishing works that no one could comprehend  Books became blander and blander due to censorship measures  and eventually  books stopped selling and authors were either locked away in insane asylums or gave up their profession and lived in exile  The only reading material that the society now accepts are captionless comics  three dimensional sex magazines  trade magazines  and scripts used during the interactive plays on the parlor walls  To get rid of the books from the past (and their copies)  the government implemented a program using the firemen to burn the books (now that houses were being rebuilt to be fire resistant) and placate the masses  As Beatty is giving his monologue  Mildred tries to fluff Montag pillow and nearly discovers the book hidden underneath  Montag yells at her and Mildred  at the request of Beatty  quietly leaves the room to watch the parlor walls  Beatty knows that Montag has a book but acts casual about it  stating that it is natural that every fireman gets curious about books and starts to possess one  If the book isn't burned or returned to the firehouse within 24 hours then the firemen will burn it for him  After Beatty has left  Montag shows Mildred the books he has hidden in the ventilator of their home  Mildred tries to incinerate the books  but Montag subdues her and tells her that the two of them are going to read the books to see if they have value  If they do not  he promises the books will be burned and all will return to normal  While going over the stolen books (and nearly getting caught by the firehouse Mechanical Hound)  Mildred argues with Montag that books have no meaning and questions why Montag dragged her into this  Montag snaps back by mentioning Mildred overdose  Clarisse death  the book woman who burned herself  and how society is falling apart due to apathy  ignorance  and a pending war  then states that maybe the books of the past have messages in them that can save society from its own destruction  Before Montag can finish  Mildred gets a call from her friends about coming over to watch The White Clown on the parlor walls  Montag laments that his wife is a lost cause (and he will be too if he can not force himself to absorb the information in the books)  Montag then remembers a man he once met in the park a year ago: Faber  a former English professor  Montag seeks Faber help  though Faber refuses at first due to his cowardice  After Montag starts to rip a few pages from the beginning of a rare copy of The New Testament (one of the few left that actually contains God word  rather than the bastardized versions that have Jesus and other Biblical characters shilling products)  Faber relents and teaches Montag about the importance of literature in its attempt to explain human existence  He gives Montag an ear piece communicator he made himself so that Faber can offer guidance throughout his daily activities  At Montag house  Mildred has friends Mrs  Phelps and Mrs  Bowles over to watch the parlor walls  In the middle of a bloody demolition derby  Montag unplugs the walls and engages the women into meaningful conversation  only to find them concerned only with pleasure in the present moment and indifferent to the upcoming war  death  their families  and politics  Montag then brings out a book of poetry to scare some emotion into them (despite Faber warnings)  Mildred tries to cover up Montag actions by claiming that  once a year  firemen bring home one book and read it aloud as a form of mocking past literature  Mildred then turns to a page in the book that has the poem Dover Beach on it and assures that none of her friends will understand any of the words  A shaken  confused Montag reads the poem  which ends up making Mrs  Phelps cry  Mrs  Bowles  however  is disgusted  accuses Montag of being nasty  and breaks off her friendship with Mildred  Montag yells at the women to go home and reflect on their empty lives and burns the poetry book while Mildred locks herself in the bathroom to take her pills  Montag returns to the firehouse the next day with only one of the books  which Beatty tosses into the trash  Beatty tells Montag that he had a dream in which they fought endlessly by quoting books to each other  In describing the dream Beatty shows that  despite his disillusionment  he was once an enthusiastic reader  A fire alarm goes off and Beatty picks up the address from the dispatcher system  He reminds Montag of his duty  theatrically leads the crew to the fire engine  and drives it to Montag house  Beatty orders Montag to destroy his own house  telling him that his wife and neighbors were the ones who reported him  Montag tries to talk to Mildred as she quickly leaves the house  but Mildred ignores him  gets inside a waiting taxi  and vanishes down the street  Montag obeys the chief  destroying the home piece by piece with a flamethrower  After he has incinerated the house  Beatty discovers Montag earpiece and plans to hunt down Faber  Montag threatens Beatty with the flamethrower and (after Beatty taunts him) burns his boss alive  As Montag flees the scene  the firehouse mechanical hound attacks him  managing to inject his leg with a tranquilizer  He destroys it with the flamethrower and limps away  Montag flees through the city streets  to Faber house  Faber urges him to make his way to the countryside and contact the exiled book lovers who live there  On Faber television  they watch news reports of another mechanical hound being released  with news helicopters following it to create a public spectacle  Montag leaves Faber house and escapes the manhunt by jumping into a river and floating downstream into the countryside  There he meets the exiles  who have memorized various books for an upcoming time when society is ready to rediscover them  The war begins  and then  just as suddenly  ends  Montag watches helplessly as jet bombers fly overhead and attack the city with nuclear weapons  During breakfast at dawn  Granger (leader of the group of wandering intellectuals) discusses the legendary phoenix and its endless cycle of long life  death in flames  and rebirth  adding that the phoenix must have some relation to mankind  which constantly repeats its mistakes  but that man has something the phoenix does not  It can remember the mistakes it made from before it destroyed itself  and try not make them again  Granger then muses that a large factory of mirrors should be built  so that mankind can take a long look at itself  After the meal is over  the band sets off back toward the city  to rebuild society ,1,0,0,0,0
270,Farmer Giles of Ham, Farmer Giles (√Ügidius Ahenobarbus Julius Agricola de Hammo  Giles Bronze beard Julius Farmer of Ham) is not a hero  He is fat and red bearded and enjoys a slow  comfortable life  But a rather deaf and short sighted giant blunders on to his land  and Giles manages to ward him away with a blunderbuss shot in his general direction  The people of the village cheer: Farmer Giles has become a hero  His reputation spreads across the kingdom  and he is rewarded by the King with a sword named Caudimordax (Tailbiter)‚Äîwhich turns out to be a powerful weapon against dragons  The giant  on returning home  relates to his friends that there are no more knights in the Middle Kingdom  just stinging flies‚Äîactually the scrap metal shot from the blunderbuss‚Äîand this entices a dragon  Chrysophylax Dives  to investigate the area  The terrified neighbours all expect the accidental hero Farmer Giles to deal with him  The story parodies the great dragon slaying traditions  The knights sent by the King to pursue the dragon are useless fops  more intent on precedence and etiquette than on the huge dragon footprints littering the landscape  The only part of a 'dragon' they know is the annual celebratory dragon tail cake  Giles by contrast clearly recognizes the danger  and resents being sent along to face it  But hapless farmers can be forced to become heroes  and Giles shrewdly makes the best of the situation ,0,1,0,0,0
271,God Emperor of Dune,The seemingly immortal God Emperor Leto II has ruled his Empire for more than 3 500 years  his lifespan lengthened due to his decision in Children of Dune to merge his human body with sandtrout  the haploid phase of the giant sandworms of Arrakis  His continued evolution has slowly transformed him  altering his human form into what he calls a pre worm  His body has come to resemble a small version of the ancient sandworms of Arrakis &mdash; ribbed  elongated  and covered in scaly sandtrout; his face remains  as do his hands and arms  but his legs and feet have atrophied to be of no use whatsoever and he moves from place to place on a large cart of Ixian manufacture  It is later revealed that his brain has gradually diffused into the rest of his body  becoming a series of nodes throughout his whole form  This distribution of internal organs and his sandtrout skin makes him virtually impervious to harm  even allowing him to survive lasgun fire  but like a sandworm his biology is very vulnerable to water  During his long reign  Leto has enforced a state of peace throughout his empire  both through tight control of his enormous (but limited) hoard of the spice melange and the military might of his Fish Speaker army  The old Imperium is basically non existent; the Landsraad has ceased to exist  and only a few remnants of the Great Houses survive  The Bene Gesserit and Spacing Guild have endured  although both have been forced to adapt to Leto absolute control over melange and his powerful prescience  and CHOAM has been reduced to a shadow of its former self  His reign is considered by many to be depraved and despotic  but he is confident that his actions will ensure the survival of the human race  Leto enforced peace brings stagnation to the galaxy; he himself battles an incessant struggle with boredom and loneliness that overwhelms him because of his everlasting life  close to absolute prescience  a loss of vulnerability which renders him incapable of physical intimacy  and his perception of the passage of time in great lengths (as decades may pass without him realizing it)  Few people realize the burden that he carries as he deems subjects useful as long as they serve a purpose to the Golden Path (the end justifying the means)  Leto maintains a small and reclusive system of government  and as God  he chooses not to share the inner workings and purpose of his decisions or any sympathy for his cause  as he knows that humanity would not be able to grasp the concept  As his father before him  Leto is utterly incapable of foreseeing his own demise  and concludes that whatever he cannot see and perceive &mdash; and thus control &mdash; is connected to his eventual death; ironically  this amuses him since it is one of the few things that still brings surprise to his otherwise dull existence  Leto has employed a series of gholas grown from the cells of Duncan Idaho  the faithful Swordmaster of House Atreides  Duncan functions both as the captain of Leto guard  and as a familiar face to calm Leto in his moments of distress  They remind Leto of his family  and he feels that he owes Duncan for his service and devotion to House Atreides  The vast majority of these gholas are made under Leto instructions of preserving the original Idaho without enhancements; Idaho masterful abilities  thus  are dwarfed by thousands of years of genetic manipulation displayed by Leto servants  Over the centuries  a significant number of the gholas have attempted to assassinate Leto through various means after struggling with the conflict between their intense loyalty to House Atreides  and the moral disgust triggered by the repression and stagnation Leto has forced upon the Empire  These feelings  compounded with the uneasy doubt caused by being millennia out of their own time  drives some of the Duncan Idaho gholas insane  Even when he does not ask for a new ghola  or considering the circumstances surrounding the previous Idaho demise  the Tleilaxu usually send one anyway as a token for their survival  Leto Golden Path  as he calls it  is a millennia spanning attempt to produce a human who is invisible to a watcher gifted with prescience  This breeding plan  begun with the marriage of Leto twin sister Ghanima to Farad'n Corrino  has resulted in Leto majordomo Moneo Atreides and his daughter Siona  Moneo has served Leto faithfully for the majority of his life  having been a rebel until he was shown the Golden Path in a test by Leto  Siona is the leader of a group of rebels seeking to overthrow the God Emperor  and locate his hidden hoard of melange  Unbeknownst to Siona  Nayla &mdash; her close friend and de facto bodyguard &mdash; worships Leto  and is under orders to protect and obey Siona in all things while reporting on her rebellious activities  Although Leto knows the important purpose of Siona  as long as she does not serve the Golden Path she would be expendable  and he would have to take measures for the breeding paths that he would have to take to replace her  During a raid on his Citadel  Siona and her friends steal  among other things  a series of excerpts from Leto private journal  Unknown to them  Leto is aware of their activities and allows them to continue  In perusing some of the items and documents stolen from the Citadel  Siona learns that Leto remains capable of love  and plots to use this as a weapon against him  At the same time  the new Ixian ambassador  Hwi Noree  is sent to the court of the God Emperor  Immediately entranced by her beauty  grace  and purity  Leto begins to be tortured by the knowledge that he and Hwi are separated by his continued transformation  For her part  Hwi desires nothing more than to serve the God Emperor  and she quickly becomes a confidante  finally expressing her love of Leto  The latest incarnation of Duncan is also captivated by Hwi beauty  but is rebuffed by Leto  who warns that Hwi is his alone  Because of his intense feelings for Hwi and the fact that she had never appeared in his prescient visions  Leto realizes that she is a trap  trained and sent by the Ixians to weaken him  However  he is unable to send her away  and she gladly accepts his offer to remain  It is revealed that Hwi had been grown inside an Ixian no room &mdash; a device that shields its occupants from prescient view &mdash; from cells of a former Ixian ambassador  Malky  who had been a cynical and roguish friend of the God Emperor  Through discussions with Moneo and Leto  Duncan learns about Leto transformation  the Fish Speakers  and the oppressive measures Leto takes to maintain his absolute control over the Empire  He begins to grow more agitated and restless  though he continues in his duties  defending the God Emperor from an attack by Tleilaxu Face Dancers  Duncan struggles with feelings of inadequacy  and the confusion and disorientation that result from existing in a time alien to him  Duncan meets Siona  and though the two of them are coldly formal to one another  they eventually unite to kill Leto and end his tyrannical rule over mankind  Leto and Hwi decide to marry  and lead a wedding procession from Leto Little Citadel to Tuono Village  where Duncan and Siona have been sent  While crossing the Idaho River  Siona orders Nayla to cut the supports of the bridge with a lasgun  spilling Moneo  Hwi  Leto  and a number of courtiers into the jagged rocks in the canyon below  Nayla obeys  despite her fanaticism toward the God Emperor  believing that the instructions are a test of her loyalty  Leto survives the fall  but is immersed in water  and his body begins to dissolve  just as did the sandworms of ancient Dune  In a final conversation with Siona and Duncan  Leto reveals that Siona is the embodiment of the Golden Path  a human completely shielded from prescient view  He explains that humanity is now free from the domination of oracles  free to scatter throughout the universe  never again to face complete domination  After revealing the location of his secret spice hoard  Leto dies  leaving Duncan and Siona to face the task of managing the empire ,1,0,0,0,0
272,Heretics of Dune, Much has changed in the millennium and a half since the death of the God Emperor  Sandworms have reappeared on Arrakis (now called Rakis) and renewed the flow of the all important spice melange to the galaxy  With Leto death  a hugely complex economic system built on spice collapsed  resulting in trillions leaving known space in a great Scattering  A new civilization has risen  with three dominant powers: the Ixians  whose no ships are capable of piloting between the stars and are invisible to outside detection; the Bene Tleilax  who have learned to manufacture spice in their axlotl tanks and have created a new breed of Face Dancers; and the Bene Gesserit  a matriarchal order of subtle political manipulators who possess superhuman abilities  However  people from the Scattering are returning with their own peculiar powers  The most powerful of these forces are the Honored Matres  a violent society of women bred and trained for combat and the sexual control of men  On Rakis  a girl called Sheeana has been discovered who can control the giant worms  The Bene Gesserit intends to use a Tleilaxu provided Duncan Idaho ghola to gain control of this sandrider  and the religious forces of mankind who they know will ultimately worship her  The Sisterhood have subtly been altering the gholas to bring their physical reflexes up to modern standards  The Bene Gesserit leader  Mother Superior Taraza  brings Miles Teg to guard the new Idaho  Taraza also sends Reverend Mother Darwi Odrade to take command of the Bene Gesserit keep on Rakis  Odrade is a loose cannon; she does not obey normal Bene Gesserit prohibitions about love  and is also Teg biological daughter  Bene Gesserit Imprinter Lucilla is also sent by Taraza to bind Idaho loyalty to the Sisterhood with her sexual talents  However  Lucilla must deal with Reverend Mother Schwangyu  head of the ghola project but also the leader of a faction within the Bene Gesserit who feel gholas are a danger  Above the planet Gammu  Taraza is captured and held hostage by the Honored Matres aboard an Ixian no ship  The Honored Matres insist Taraza invite Teg to the ship  hoping to gain control of the ghola project  Teg manages to turn the tables on the Matres  and rescues the Mother Superior and her party  An attack is then made on Sheeana on Rakis  which is prevented by the intervention of the Bene Gesserit  Odrade starts training Sheeana as a Bene Gesserit  At about the same time an attempt is made on the life of Idaho  but Teg is able to defeat it  Teg flees with Duncan and Lucilla into the countryside  In an ancient Harkonnen no globe  Teg proceeds to awaken Idaho original memories  but does so before Lucilla can imprint Duncan and thus tie him to the Sisterhood  In the meantime  Taraza has been searching for Teg and his party  and finally establishes contact  During the operation  however  Teg and his companions are ambushed  Teg is captured while Lucilla and Duncan escape  Teg is tortured by a T Probe  but under pressure discovers a new ability: he is able to speed up his physical and mental reactions  which enables him to escape  At the same time  Idaho is ambushed and taken hostage  Taraza arranges a meeting with the Tleilaxu Master Waff  who is soon forced to tell her what he knows about the Honored Matres  When pressed on the issue of Idaho  he also admits that the Bene Tleilax have conditioned their own agenda into him  As the meeting draws to a close  Taraza accidentally divines that Waff is a Zensunni  giving the Bene Gesserit a lever to understand their ancient competitor  She and Odrade meet Waff again on Rakis  He tries to assassinate Taraza but Odrade convinces him that the Sisterhood shares the religious beliefs of the Bene Tleilax  Taraza offers full alliance with them against the onslaught of forces out of the Scattering  This agreement causes consternation among the Bene Gesserit  but Odrade realizes that Taraza plan is to destroy Rakis  By destroying the planet  the Bene Gesserit would be dependent on the Tleilaxu for the spice  ensuring an alliance  Lucilla arrives at a Bene Gesserit safe house to discover it has been taken over by Honored Matres  who have Idaho as their captive  As Lucilla infiltrates it  the young Honored Matre Murbella proceeds to seduce the captured Idaho with the Honored Matre imprinting method  However  hidden Tleilaxu conditioning kicks in  and Duncan responds with an equal technique  one that overwhelms Murbella  Lucilla takes advantage of Murbella exhaustion to knock her unconscious and rescue Duncan  The Honored Matres attack Rakis  killing Taraza  Odrade becomes temporary leader of the Bene Gesserit before escaping with Sheeana into the desert on a worm  Teg also goes to a supposed safe house  only to discover the Honored Matres  He unleashes himself upon the complex  before capturing a no ship and locating Duncan and Lucilla  They and the captured Murbella are taken to Rakis with him  When they arrive  Teg finds Odrade and Sheeana and their giant worm  He loads them all up in his no ship  finally leading his troops out on a last suicidal defense of Rakis  designed to attract the rage of the Honored Matres  The Honored Matres attack Rakis  destroying the planet and the sandworms except for the one the Bene Gesserit escape with  They drown the worm in a mixture of water and spice  turning it into sandtrout which will turn the secret Bene Gesserit planet Chapterhouse into another Dune ,1,0,0,0,0

274,Neuromancer,Henry Dorsett Case is a low level hustler in the dystopian underworld of Chiba City  Japan  Once a talented computer hacker  Case was caught stealing from his employer  As punishment for his theft  Case central nervous system was damaged with a mycotoxin  leaving him unable to use keyboard skills to access the global computer network in cyberspace  a virtual reality dataspace called the Matrix  Unemployable  addicted to drugs  and suicidal  Case desperately searches the Chiba black clinics for a miracle cure  Case is saved by Molly Millions  an augmented street samurai and mercenary for a shadowy ex military officer named Armitage  who offers to cure Case in exchange for his services as a hacker  Case jumps at the chance to regain his life as a console cowboy  but neither Case nor Molly know what Armitage is really planning  Case nervous system is repaired using new technology that Armitage offers the clinic as payment  but he soon learns from Armitage that sacs of the poison that first crippled him have been placed in his blood vessels as well  Armitage promises Case that if he completes his work in time  the sacs will be removed; otherwise they will dissolve  disabling him again  He also has Case pancreas replaced and new tissue grafted into his liver  leaving Case incapable of metabolizing cocaine or amphetamines and apparently ending his drug addiction  Case develops a close personal relationship with Molly  who suggests that he begin looking into Armitage background  Meanwhile  Armitage assigns them their first job: they must steal a ROM module that contains the saved consciousness of one of Case mentors  legendary cyber cowboy McCoy Pauley  nicknamed Dixie Flatline  Pauley hacking expertise is needed by Armitage  and the ROM construct is stored in the corporate headquarters of media conglomerate Sense/Net  A street gang named the Panther Moderns are hired to create a simulated terrorist attack on Sense/Net  The diversion allows Molly to penetrate the building and steal Dixie ROM  Case and Molly continue to investigate Armitage  discovering his former identity of Colonel Willis Corto  Corto was a member of Operation Screaming Fist  which planned on infiltrating and disrupting Soviet computer systems from ultralight aircraft dropped over Russia  The Russian military had learned of the idea and installed defenses to render the attack impossible  but the military went ahead with Screaming Fist  with a new secret purpose of testing these Russian defenses  As the Operation team attacked a Soviet computer center  EMP weapons shut down their computers and flight systems  and Corto and his men were targeted by Soviet laser defenses  He and a few survivors commandeered a Soviet military helicopter and escaped over the heavily guarded Finnish border  Everyone was killed except Corto  who was seriously wounded and heavily mutilated by Finnish defense forces attacking as they were landing the helicopter  Corto after some months in hospital is visited by a Government military official and then medically rebuilt to be able to provide what he came to realise was fake testimony  designed to mislead the public and protect the military officers who had covered up knowledge of the EMP weapons  After the trials  Corto snaps  killing the Government official who contacted him and then disappears into the criminal underworld  In Istanbul  the team recruits Peter Riviera  an artist  thief  and drug addict who is able to project detailed holographic illusions with the aid of sophisticated cybernetic implants  Although Riviera is a sociopath  Armitage coerces him into joining the team  The trail leads Case and Molly to a powerful artificial intelligence named Wintermute  created by the plutocratic Tessier Ashpool family  who spend most of their inactive time in cryonic preservation inside Villa Straylight  a labyrinthine mansion located at one end of Freeside  a cylindrical space habitat located at L5  and functioning primarily as a Las Vegas style space resort for the wealthy  Wintermute nature is finally revealed ‚Äì it is one half of a super AI entity planned by the family  although its exact purpose is unknown  The Turing Law Code governing AIs bans the construction of such entities; to get around this  it had to be built as two separate AIs  Wintermute was programmed by the Tessier Ashpool dynasty with a need to merge with its other half ‚Äì Neuromancer  Unable to achieve this merger on its own  Wintermute recruited Armitage and his team to help complete the goal  Case is tasked with entering cyberspace to pierce the Turing imposed software barriers using a powerful icebreaker program  At the same time  Riviera is to obtain the password to the Turing lock from Lady 3Jane Marie France Tessier Ashpool  an unfrozen daughter clone and the current leader of Tessier Ashpool SA  Wintermute believes Riviera will pose an irresistible temptation to her  and that she will give him the password  The password must be spoken into an ornate computer terminal located in the Tessier Ashpool home in Villa Straylight  and entered simultaneously as Case pierces the software barriers in cyberspace ‚Äì otherwise the Turing lock will remain intact  Armitage team attracts the attention of the Turing Police  whose job is to prevent AIs from exceeding their built in limitations  As Molly and Riviera gain entrance to Villa Straylight  three officers arrest Case and take him into custody; Wintermute manipulates the orbital casino security and maintenance systems and kills the officers  allowing Case to escape  The Armitage personality starts to disintegrate and revert to the Corto personality as he relives Screaming Fist  It is revealed that in the past  Wintermute had originally contacted Corto through a bedside computer during his convalescence  eventually convincing Corto that he was Armitage  Wintermute used him to persuade Case and Molly to help it merge with its twin AI  Neuromancer  Finally  Armitage becomes the shattered Corto again  but his newfound personality is short lived as he is killed by Wintermute  Inside Villa Straylight  Molly is captured by Riviera and Lady 3Jane  Worried about Molly and operating under orders from Wintermute  Case tracks her down with help from Maelcum  his Rastafarian pilot  Neuromancer attempts to trap Case within a cyber construct where he finds the consciousness of Linda Lee  his girlfriend from Chiba City  who was murdered by one of Case underworld contacts  Case manages to escape flatlining inside the construct by choosing of his own free will not to stay  Freeing himself  Case takes Maelcum and confronts Lady 3Jane  Riviera  and Hideo  Lady 3Jane ninja bodyguard  Riviera tries to kill Case  but Lady 3Jane is sympathetic towards Case and Molly  and Hideo protects him  Riviera blinds Hideo  but flees when he learns that the ninja is just as adept without his sight  Molly then explains to Case that Riviera is doomed anyway  as he has been fatally poisoned by his drugs  which she had spiked  With Lady 3Jane in possession of the password  the team makes it to the computer terminal  Case ascends to cyberspace to guide the icebreaker to penetrate its target; Lady 3Jane is induced to give up her password and the lock is opened  Wintermute unites with Neuromancer  fusing into a greater entity  The poison in Case bloodstream is washed out  and he and Molly are handsomely paid for their efforts  while Pauley ROM construct is apparently erased  at his own request  In the epilogue  Molly leaves Case  Case finds a new girlfriend  resumes his hacking work  and spends his earnings from the mission replacing his internal organs so that he can continue his previous drug use  Wintermute/Neuromancer contacts him  saying that it has become the sum total of the works  the whole show  and has begun looking for other AIs like itself  Scanning old recorded transmissions from the 1970s  the super AI finds a lone AI transmitting from the Alpha Centauri star system  In the matrix  Case hears inhuman laughter  a trait associated with Pauley during Case work with his ROM construct  thus suggesting that Pauley was not erased after all  but instead worked out a side deal with Wintermute/Neuromancer to be freed from the construct so he could exist in the matrix  In the end  while logged into the matrix  Case catches a glimpse of himself  his dead girlfriend Linda Lee  and Neuromancer  The implication of the sighting is that Neuromancer created a copy of Case consciousness when it previously tried to trap him  The copy of Case consciousness now exists with that of Linda  in the matrix  where they are together forever ,1,0,0,0,0
275,The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, The story begins in a future world where global warming has resulted in global temperatures so high that in most of the world it is unsafe to be outside without special cooling gear during daylight hours  In a desperate bid to preserve humanity and ease population burdens on Earth  the UN has initiated a draft for colonizing the nearby planets  where conditions are so horrific and primitive that the unwilling colonists have fallen prey to a form of escapism involving the use of an illegal drug (CAN D) in concert with layouts  Layouts are physical props intended to simulate a sort of alternate reality where life is easier than either the grim existence of the colonist in their marginal off world colonies  or even Earth  where global warming has progressed to the point that Antarctica is prime vacation resort territory  The illegal drug CAN D allows people to share their experience of the Perky Pat (the name of the main female character in the simulated world) layouts  This sharing has caused a pseudo religious cult or series of cults to grow up around the layouts and the use of the drug  Up to the point where the novel begins  New York City based Perky Pat (or P P ) Layouts  Inc   has held a monopoly on this product  as well as on the illegal trade in the drug CAN D which makes the shared hallucinations possible  The novel opens shortly after Barney Mayerson  P P  Layouts' top precognitive (someone who can glimpse future possibilities and sort out the most likely to actually occur)  has received a draft notice from the UN for involuntary resettlement as a colonist on Mars  Mayerson is sleeping with his assistant  Roni Fugate  but remains conflicted about the divorce  which he himself initiated  from his first wife Emily  a ceramic pot artist  Meanwhile  Emily second husband tries to sell her pot designs to P P  Layouts as possible accessories for the Perky Pat virtual worlds    but Barney  recognizing them as Emily  rejects them out of spite  Meanwhile  the UN rescues Palmer Eldritch ship from a crash on Pluto  Leo Bulero  head of P P  Layouts and an evolved human (meaning someone who has undergone expensive genetic treatments by a German doctor which are supposed to push the client forward on an evolutionary scale  and which result in gross physical  as well as mental  modifications)  hears rumors that Eldritch discovered an alien hallucinogen in the Prox system with similar properties to CAN D  and that he plans to market it as Chew Z  with U N  approval  on off world colonies  However CHEW Z does not require the prop of the external layouts and seems to have certain undefined qualities that make the use of CHEW Z even more addictive than CAN D has been  This would effectively destroy P P  Layouts  Bulero tries to contact Eldritch but he is quarantined at a U N  hospital  Both Mayerson and Fugate have precognitions of reports that Bulero is going to be responsible for murdering Eldritch  Meanwhile  Emily and her second husband sell her pottery designs to Eldritch and use the payment to undergo evolution therapy  Unfortunately  Emily begins to devolve rather than evolving  This devolution results in a loss of creativity and she finds herself recreating older  less sophisticated designs from earlier work  without realizing it  Under the guise of a reporter  Bulero travels to Eldritch estate on the Moon  where Eldritch holds a press conference  Bulero is kidnapped and forced to take Chew Z intravenously  He enters a psychic netherworld over which both he and Eldritch seemingly have some control  After wrangling about business with Eldritch  Bulero travels to what appears to be Earth at some time in the not too distant future  Evolved humans identify him as a ghost and show him a monument to himself commemorating his role in the death of Eldritch  an enemy of the Sol System  Bulero returns to Earth and fires Mayerson because Mayerson was afraid to travel to the Moon to rescue him  Mayerson  in despair  accepts his UN conscription to Mars but Bulero recruits him as a double agent  Mayerson is to inject himself with a virus after taking Chew Z in a plot to deceive the UN into thinking Chew Z is harmful and cause them to ban it  On Mars  Mayerson buys some Chew Z from Eldritch  who appears in holographic form  Mayerson tries to hallucinate a world where he is still with Emily but finds that he does not control his hallucination  Like Bulero  he finds himself in the future  Mayerson arrives in New York two years hence where he speaks with Bulero  Fugate and his future self about the death of Palmer Eldritch  He also encounters several manifestations of Eldritch  identifiable by their robotic right hand  artificial eyes  and steel teeth  Eldritch offers to help Mayerson ‚Äúbecome‚Äù whatever he wants  but in fact is so manipulative and controlling of the CHEW Z alternate reality that Mayerson ultimately decides he'd rather be dead than continue to be manipulated by Eldritch  When a despairing Mayerson chooses death  he finds himself apparently forced into Eldritch body right at the point in the timeline where Bulero is ready to shoot a torpedo at Eldritch ship  It appears that Eldritch plan is to preserve his own life essence housed in Mayerson body while allowing Mayerson himself to die in Eldritch place  Eldritch  meanwhile  intends to live on in Mayerson form and enjoy the simple if arduous life of a Martian colonist  Mayerson  stuck in Eldritch body and mistaken for him  is indeed nearly killed by Bulero in the near future  but before the fatal shot can be fired he is awakened from his Chew Z trance in the present by Bulero  who has just arrived on Mars  Bulero is willing to take Mayerson back to Earth but refuses to after learning that Mayerson did not inject himself with the virus  Mayerson is now confident that Bulero will kill Eldritch  so the sacrifice of taking the virus in order to ruin Eldritch business is unnecessary; but he does not try to convince Bulero of this  Later  Mayerson discusses his experience with a neo christian colonist and they conclude that either Eldritch became a god in the Prox system or some god like being has taken his place  Mayerson is convinced some aspect of Eldritch is still inside him  and that as long as he refuses to take Chew Z again  it is Eldritch who will actually be killed by Bulero in the near future; Mayerson is half resigned  half hopeful about taking on the life of a Martian colonist without reprieve  Mayerson considers the possibility of Eldritch being what humans have always thought of as a god  but inimical  or perhaps merely an inferior aspect of a bigger and better sort of god  The novel has an ambiguous ending

276,Time out of Joint,As the novel opens  its protagonist Ragle Gumm believes that he lives in the year 1959 in a quiet American suburb  His unusual profession consists of repeatedly winning the cash prize in a local newspaper competition called  Where Will The Little Green Man Be Next   Gumm 1959 has some differences from ours: the Tucker car is in production  AM/FM radios are scarce to non existent and Marilyn Monroe is a complete unknown  As the novel opens  strange things begin to happen to Gumm  A soft drink stand disappears  replaced by a small slip of paper with the words SOFT DRINK STAND printed on it in block letters  Intriguing little pieces of the real 1959 turn up: a magazine article on Marilyn Monroe  a telephone book with non operational exchanges listed and radios hidden away in someone else house  People with no apparent connection to Gumm  including military pilots using aircraft transceivers  refer to him by name  Few other characters notice these or experience similar anomalies; the sole exception is Gumm supposed brother in law  Victor Vic Nielson  in whom he confides  A neighborhood woman  Mrs  Keitelbein  invites him to a Civil Defense class where he sees a model of a futuristic underground military factory  He has the unshakeable feeling he is been inside that building many times before  Confusion gradually mounts for Gumm  His neighbor Bill Black knows far more about these events than he admits  and  observing this  begins worrying: Suppose Ragle [Gumm] is becoming sane again  In fact  Gumm does become sane  and the deception surrounding him (erected to protect and exploit him) begins to unravel  Gumm tries to escape the town and is turned back by kafkaesque obstructions  He sees a magazine with himself on the cover  in a military uniform  at the factory depicted in the model  He tries a second time to escape  this time with Vic  and succeeds  He learns that his idyllic town is a constructed reality designed to protect him from the frightening fact that he lives on a then future Earth (circa 1998) that is at war with its colonists on the Moon who are fighting for a permanent Lunar habitation that is politically independent of Earth as well  Gumm has a unique ability to predict where the colonists' nuclear strikes will be aimed  Previously Gumm did this work for the military  but then he defected to the colonists' side and planned to secretly emigrate to the Moon  But before this could happen he began retreating into a fantasy world based largely upon the relatively idyllic surroundings of his extreme youth  He was no longer able to shoulder the awesome responsibility of being the Earth lone protector from Lunar launched H Bomb attacks  The fake town was thereby created in Gumm mental image to accommodate his dementia so that he would continue predicting missile strikes in the guise of submitting entries to a harmless newspaper contest and without the ethical qualms involved with being on the wrong side of a civil war  When Gumm finally remembers his true history he decides to emigrate to the Moon after all because he feels that exploration and migration  being as they are basic human impulses  should never be denied a people by any national or planetary government  Vic rejects this belief  referring to the colonists essentially as aggressors and terrorists  and returns to the town  The book ends with some hope for peace  because the colonists are more willing to negotiate than the Earth government has been telling its citizens ,1,0,0,0,0

278,Radio Free Albemuth,In this alternate history the corrupt US President Ferris F  Fremont (FFF for 666  ‚ÄòF‚Äô being the 6th letter in the alphabet  see Number of the Beast) becomes Chief Executive in the late Nineteen Sixties following Lyndon Johnson administration  The character is best described as an amalgam of Joseph McCarthy and Richard Nixon  who abrogates civil liberties and human rights through positing a conspiracy theory centered around a (presumably) fictitious subversive organization known as Aramchek  In addition to this  he is associated with a right wing populist movement called Friends of the American People (FAPers)  Ironically enough  the President paranoia and opportunism lead to the establishment of a real resistance movement that is organized through narrow beam radio transmissions from a mysterious alien near Earth satellite  by a superintelligent  extraterrestrial  but less than omnipotent being (or network) named VALIS  As with its successor  VALIS  this novel is autobiographical  Dick himself is a major character  though fictitious protagonist Nicholas Brady serves as a vehicle for Dick alleged gnostic theophany on February 11  1974  In addition  Sadassa Silvia is a character who claims that Ferris Fremont is actually a communist covert agent recruited by Sadassa mother when Fremont was still a teenager  As with VALIS  Radio Free Albemuth deals with author Philip Dick highly personal style of Christianity (or Gnosticism)  It further examines the moral and ethical repercussions of informing on trusting friends for the authorities  Also prominent is Dick dislike of the Republican Party  satirizing Nixon America as a Stalinist or neo fascist police state  Fremont eventually captures and imprisons Dick and Brady after the latter attempts to produce and distribute a record that contains subliminal messages of revolt against the current dictatorship  Brady and Silvia are executed  and Dick narrates the concluding passage about his life in a concentration camp  where his supposedly latest work is actually penned by a ghost writer and regime approved hack  Suddenly  however  he hears music blaring from a transistor radio which contains the same subliminal message  He and his friends  it turns out  were just a decoy set up by VALIS to detour the government from stopping a much more popular A List band from releasing a similar record with a better established recording company  As Dick realizes this and hears youngsters repeating the lyrics he realizes that salvation may lie within the hearts and minds of the next generation ,1,0,0,0,0
279,Ringworld,The novel opens in 2850  Louis Gridley Wu is celebrating his 200th birthday  Despite his age  Louis is in perfect physical condition but is bored  He has experienced life thoroughly  and is thinking of taking a trip to and beyond the reaches of Known Space  all alone in a spaceship for a year or more  He is confronted by Nessus  a Pierson Puppeteer  and offered one of three open positions on an exploration voyage beyond Known Space  Speaker to Animals (Speaker)  who is a Kzin  and Teela Brown  a young human woman  also join the voyage  They first travel to the Puppeteer home world  where they learn that the expedition goal is to explore a ringworld: an artificial ring about one million miles wide and approximately the diameter of Earth orbit (which makes it about 600 million miles in circumference)  encircling a Sol type star  It rotates  providing artificial gravity that is 99 2% as strong as Earth gravity through the action of centrifugal force  The ringworld has a habitable flat inner surface equivalent in area to approximately three million Earth sized planets  Night is provided by an inner ring of shadow squares which are connected to each other by thin  ultra strong wire (shadow square wire)  None of the crew attempts at contacting the Ringworld succeed  and their ship is disabled by its automated meteor defense system  The severely damaged vessel collides with a strand of shadow square wire and crash lands on the Ringworld near a huge mountain  The ship defences keep the crew compartment and many of the ship systems intact  including the faster than light drive (hyperdrive)  but the normal drive is destroyed  leaving them unable to launch back into space to use the hyperdrive  The team now has to set out to find a way to get back into space  as well as fulfilling their original mission ‚Äì learning more about the Ringworld  Using their flycycles  they try to reach the rim of the ring  where they hope to find some technology that will help them  It will take them months to cross the vast distance  When Teela develops Plateau trance  they find themselves forced to land  On the ground  they encounter apparently human Ringworld natives  The natives  who are living primitively in the crumbling ruins of a once advanced city  think that the crew are the Engineers of the Ring  whom they revere as gods  The crew is attacked when they commit a blasphemy  They continue their journey during which Nessus is forced to reveal some Puppeteer secrets: they have performed indirect breeding experiments on both humans (breeding for luck) and kzin (breeding for less aggressiveness)  The resulting hostility forces Nessus to abandon the other three and follow them at a safe distance  They encounter a city and  in a floating building  they find a map of the Ringworld and videos of its past civilization  In a giant storm  caused by air escaping through a hole in the Ring floor due to meteor impact  Teela is blown away in an unknown direction  While searching for her in a ruined city Louis' and Speaker flycycles are caught by an automatic police station designed to catch traffic offenders  They are trapped in a prison in the basement of the police station  Nessus arrives  entering the station to help his team  In the station they meet Halrloprillalar Hotrufan (Prill)  a former crew member of a spaceship used for trade between the Ringworld and other inhabited worlds  Her spaceship was stranded on the Ringworld when the landing mechanism failed  She relates what she learned of the downfall of the Ringworld civilization: A mold that breaks down superconductors was introduced by a visiting spaceship  Without its superconductive technology  civilization fell  Teela reaches the police station  accompanied by her new lover  a native hero called Seeker who helped her survive  Based on his studies of an ancient Ringworld map  Louis devises a plan to escape  The four explorers  with Seeker and Prill  use the floating police station as a vehicle to travel back to the explorers' crashed ship  Along the way  Teela and Seeker choose to remain behind  to inhabit a flying castle and remain on Ringworld  The remaining explorers and Prill collect one end of the shadow square wire that was dislodged when the ship crashed  dragging the wire behind them as they travel  Reaching the wreck  Louis threads the shadow wire through the crashed ship and uses it to tether the ship to the police station  and then continues to pull the wire onward  up to the summit of Fist of God  the enormous mountain near their crash site  The massive mountain does not appear on a map of the original Ringworld  leading Louis to conclude that it is in fact the result of a meteor impact with the underside of the ring  which pushed the mountain up from the ring floor and broke through  The top of the mountain  above the edge of the Ring atmosphere  is therefore a passage to the underside of the Ringworld and freedom  Louis drives the police station over the edge of the crater  Because the Ringworld spins fast enough to provide gravity  once the police station and ship are on the underside  centrifugal force pushes them outward from the ring into open space  The crew can then use the ship faster than light drive to get home  The book concludes with Louis and Speaker discussing returning to the Ringworld

280,Rendezvous with Rama,After a major disaster caused by a meteorite falling in Eastern Italy in 2077  the government of Earth sets up the Spaceguard system as an early warning of arrivals from deep space  The Rama of the title is an alien star ship  initially mistaken for an asteroid categorised as 31/439  It is detected by astronomers in the year 2130 while still outside the orbit of Jupiter  The object speed (100&nbsp;000&nbsp;km/h) and the angle of its trajectory clearly indicate that this is not an object on a long orbit around our sun; it comes from interstellar space  Astronomers' interest is further piqued when they realise that this asteroid not only has an extremely rapid rotation period of 4 minutes  but it is exceptionally large  It is subsequently renamed Rama after the Hindu god and an unmanned space probe dubbed Sita is launched from the Mars moon Phobos to intercept and photograph the object  The resulting images taken during its rapid flyby reveal that Rama is a perfect cylinder  in diameter and long  made of a completely featureless material  making this humankind first encounter with an alien space ship  The manned solar survey vessel Endeavour is sent to study Rama  as it is the only ship close enough to do so in the brief period Rama will spend in our solar system  Endeavour manages to rendezvous with Rama one month after the space ship first comes to Earth attention  when the giant alien spacecraft is already within Venus' orbit  The 20+ crew  led by Commander Bill Norton  enters Rama through triple airlocks  and explores the vast 16 km wide by 50 km long cylindrical world of its interior  but the nature and purpose of the starship and its creators remains enigmatic throughout the book  Inside Rama  the air is discovered to be breathable  The astronauts discover several features  including cities (odd blocky shapes that look like buildings  and streets with shallow trenches in them  looking like trolley car tracks) that actually served as factories  a sea that stretches in a band around Rama dubbed the Cylindrical Sea  and seven massive cones at the southern end of Rama   believed to form part of the propulsion system  One of the crew members  Jimmy Pak  who has experience with low gravity skybikes  volunteers to ride a smuggled skybike along Rama axis to the far end  otherwise inaccessible due to the cylindrical sea and the 500 m high cliff on the opposite shore  A few hours later  Jimmy reaches the massive metal cones on the southern end of Rama  picking up a strange magnetic field coming from the cones  Pak takes a few pictures of the area and the strange plateau on the southern end of Rama landmass before leaving  The electrical charge in the atmosphere begins to increase during Pak return  resulting in lightning  A discharge hits his skybike causing him to crash on the isolated southern continent  When Pak wakes up  he sees a crab like creature picking up his skybike and chopping it into pieces  He cannot decide whether it is a robot or a biological alien  and keeps his distance while contacting Norton and the others on the other side of Rama for help  Norton sends a rescue party across the cylindrical sea  using a small  improvised craft  and Pak waits  He sees the crab like creature dump the remains of the skybike into the sea  and he approaches the creature  but it completely ignores him  Pak explores the surrounding fields while waiting for the rescue party to arrive on the southern cliffs of the cylindrical sea  Amongst the strange geometric patterns he sees an alien flower growing through a cracked tile in the otherwise sterile environment  and decides to take it as both a curiosity and for scientific research  Pak jumps off the 500m cliff  his descent slowed by low gravity and using his shirt as a parachute  and swims quickly to the craft  The ride back is highlighted by tidal waves in the cylindrical sea  formed by movements of Rama itself as it makes course corrections  When the crew arrive at base  they see a variety of odd creatures inspecting their camp  When one is found damaged and apparently lifeless  the team doctor/biologist Surgeon Commander Laura Ernst inspects it and names it a biot or a hybrid of a biological entity and robot  She concludes that it  and others  appear to be electrically powered by natural internal batteries (much like terrestrial electric eels) and possess some degree of intelligence  They are believed to be the servants of Rama still absent builders and maintainers of the starship  The members of the Rama Committee and the United Planets  both based on the moon  have been monitoring events inside Rama and giving feedback  The Hermian colonists have concluded that Rama is a potential threat to them and send a rocket mounted bomb to destroy Rama  It is successfully defused by Lt Boris Rodrigo using a pair of wire cutters  As Rama approaches perihelion  the biots act strangely   jumping into the cylindrical sea where they are destroyed by aquatic biots (harks')  and absorbed back into the mineral laden water  On one last expedition to explore Rama  a few crew members decide to visit the city London (chosen as closest to the stairways at the northern end of the cylinder they use to return to their ship) to use a laser to cut open one of the buildings and see what is inside  Inside  they discover pedestals containing holograms of various artifacts  believed to have been used by the Ramans as tools and other objects  The holograms themselves are presumed to be templates for replicating these items as needed  The most amazing sight is what appears to be a uniform with bandoliers  straps and pockets that suggests the size and shape of the Ramans  But before the crew can photograph any more holograms  the lights start going out  and they must leave  They all exit up through the stairway on Rama northern side  out of the three airlocks  and board Endeavour  When Endeavour is a safe distance away  and Rama reaches perihelion  Rama harnesses the Sun gravitational field with its mysterious space drive for use in a slingshot manoeuvre and is flung out of the solar system toward an unknown location in the direction of the Large Magellanic Cloud  The book was meant to stand alone  although the final sentence of the book suggests otherwise: Clarke  however  denied that this sentence was meant to hint at a continuation of the story ‚Äìaccording to his foreword in the book sequel  it was just a good way to end the book and was added during a final revision ,1,0,0,0,0
281,Speaker for the Dead, On Novinha request for a Speaker  Andrew Wiggin leaves for Lusitania  a colony turned into a virtual prison  with its expansion severely limited and its whole existence devoted to the work of xenologers who study the Pequeninos  the first sentient beings found since the destruction of Formics  Lusitania itself is remarkably lacking in biodiversity  featuring thousands of unfilled ecological niches  The other outstanding feature of Lusitania is the Descolada  a native virus which almost wipes out the colony  until husband and wife biologists Gusta and Cida succeed in developing counters  Unfortunately  they didn't find the cure soon enough to save themselves  leaving orphaned daughter Novinha to strike out for herself  At the age of thirteen  Novinha  a cold and distant girl  successfully petitions to be made the official biologist of the colony (roughly the equivalent of a master degree); from then on  she contributes to the work of father and son xenologers (alien anthropology) Pipo and Libo  and for a short time there is family and camaraderie  One day  however  she makes a discovery about the descolada‚Äîthat it is in every native lifeform‚Äîand Pipo rushes out to talk to the piggies about the discovery without telling her or Libo why it is important  They can not figure it out on their own  and never learn‚Äîa few hours later  Pipo is found vivisected in the grass; his corpse does not even have the benefit of a tree (The symbol of honor placed among all dead piggies)  Novinha erases all the lab work  but cannot delete the information itself due to regulations; Libo demands to see it  but even their love for each other will not make her let him see it‚Äîit appears to be a secret the piggies will kill to keep  Now Novinha is determined to ensure they never marry  the way they always planned to: for if they do  Libo will have access to those locked files and  Novinha fears  will share the same fate as his father  In anguish  Novinha calls for a Speaker for the Dead  hoping beyond hope that perhaps the original Speaker may arrive  to make sense of Pipo death‚Äîand maybe of her life  Andrew Wiggin does not dare let himself be known as Ender anymore; the name is now an Epithet  Ender decides to leave his sister Valentine behind (she is married and pregnant) after traveling with her for many years  He leaves as soon as possible  with his only companion being Jane  an artificial sentience existing within the ansible computer network by which spaceships and planets communicate instantly across galactic distances  He arrives on Lusitania after twenty two years in transit (only around two weeks to him) to discover that Novinha has canceled her call  or rather tried to  as a call for a speaker cannot legally be canceled after the speaker has begun the journey  However  two others have called  making Ender trip not entirely in vain: they are Novinha eldest son Miro  calling for someone to speak the death of Libo  who was killed the same way his father was; and Novinha eldest daughter Ela  calling for someone to speak the death of Novinha husband Marcos Ribeira  who died not six weeks ago from a terminal disease  Besides attempting to unravel the question of why Novinha married Marc√£o when she really loved Libo (Marc√£o was sterile  and a quick genetic scan on Jane part reveals that Novinha children are all  in fact  Libo)  Ender also takes responsibility for attempting to heal the Ribeira family  and manages to adopt (or perhaps is adopted by) most of the children within their first meeting  He also takes a strong interest in the pequeninos  and eventually (in direct violation of Starways Congress law) meets with them in person  The Hive Queen has also managed to make contact with the pequeninos philotically  and has told them a number of things&mdash;including the fact that Andrew Wiggin is not only the original Speaker for the Dead  but the original Xenocide as well  which romantically involved Zenadors (a shortened form of the word xenologists) Miro and Ouanda do not believe  The Hive Queen very emphatically wants to be revived and freed on Lusitania  Finally  in an effort to help Ender  Jane deliberately reveals to Starways Congress that Miro and Ouanda  continuing the legacy of Ouanda dead father Libo  have been deliberately introducing new technology into the piggy lifestyle  Both Zenadors are called away to the nearest world for trial (a journey that would take twenty two years)  the colony charter is revoked  and all humans are ordered to evacuate posthaste  leaving no sign of ever having been there  Ender holds a public speaking for Marc√£o  Novinha late husband  However  Ender cannot but help reveal secrets from the lives of Libo  Pipo  and even Novinha herself as their lives were all so delicately bound together by guilt  deception  and love  The Speaker explains how Novinha blames herself for Pipo death  and underwent a life of suffering and deception‚Äîmarrying Marc√£o so that to prevent Libo from accessing the information which killed Pipo  but secretly trysting with Libo‚Äîbecause their love for each other never truly died  The meaning of Pipo and Libo murders come out as well: the trees are the third stage in the life of the piggies  Trees grown from piggies killed normally become brothertrees  but the ritually dissected ones are done so in order to make them fathertrees‚Äîsentient  living trees that are  unlike animal pequeninos  capable of reproduction (the descolada is proved to be instrumental in these transformations)  Finally  the Speaker for the Dead is able to work out a treaty with the piggies  so that humans and pequeninos might live in peace  Unfortunately  it is not without cost: Miro  distraught to learn that Ouanda  his girlfriend in secret  is actually his sister  attempts to cross the fence  which separates the humans from the piggies  and suffers significant neurological damage  With no other way to save him  the colony declares itself in rebellion  Jane shuts off outside ansible contact  Miro is rescued  and Ender enters the forest to negotiate the aforementioned treaty  He signs it Ender Wiggin  and for the first time in his life  someone (Novinha) is prepared to receive the Xenocide with compassion instead of revulsion  Valentine and her family plan to come to Lusitania to help out in the rebellion  aided by Jane; Miro  with his crippled body  is sent into space to meet them; the Hive Queen is released  ready to begin the continuation of her species; and Ender marries Novinha ,1,0,0,0,0
282,Starship Troopers,Starship Troopers takes place in the midst of an interstellar war between the Terran Federation of Earth and the Arachnids (referred to as The Bugs) of Klendathu  It is narrated as a series of flashbacks by Juan Rico  and is one of only a few Heinlein novels set out in this fashion  The novel opens with Rico aboard the corvette Rodger Young (named after Medal of Honor winner Rodger Wilton Young)  serving with the platoon known as Rasczak Roughnecks (named after the platoon leader  Lt  Rasczak) about to embark on a raid against the planet of the Skinnies  who are allies of the Arachnids  We learn that he is a cap(sule) trooper in the Terran Federation Mobile Infantry  The raid itself  one of the few instances of actual combat in the novel  is relatively brief: the Roughnecks land on the planet  destroy their targets  and retreat  suffering a single casualty in the process (Dizzy Flores  who dies in the retrieval boat of wounds received in action)  The story then flashes back to Rico graduation from high school  and his decision to sign up for Federal Service over the objections of his father  who disowns him  This is the only chapter that describes Rico civilian life  and most of it is spent on the monologues of two people: retired Lt  Col  Jean V  Dubois  Rico school instructor in History and Moral Philosophy  and Fleet Sergeant Ho  a recruiter for the armed forces of the Terran Federation  Some see Dubois as speaking for Heinlein throughout the novel; he delivers what is probably the book most famous soliloquy on violence  it     has settled more issues in history than has any other factor  Fleet Sergeant Ho monologues examine the nature of military service  and his anti military tirades seem primarily to be a contrast with Dubois  We learn  later  that his rants are part of a policy intended to scare off applicants signing up without conviction  Interspersed throughout the book are other flashbacks to Rico high school History and Moral Philosophy course  which describe how in the Terran Federation of Rico day  the rights of a full Citizen (to vote  and hold public office) must be earned through some form of volunteer Federal service  Those residents who have not exercised their right to perform this Federal Service retain all other rights generally associated with a modern democracy (free speech  assembly  etc )  but they cannot vote or hold public office  This structure arose ad hoc after the collapse of the 20th century Western democracies  brought on by both social failures at home (among which appear to be poor handling of juvenile delinquency) and military defeat by the Chinese Hegemony overseas  In the next section of the novel  after being denied all his higher preferred Service choices  Rico goes to boot camp at Camp Arthur Currie  on the northern prairies  Five chapters are spent exploring Rico experience there  including his adjustment to a very different situation  entering the service under the training of the leading instructor  career Ship Sergeant Charles Zim  Camp Currie is rigorous by design; less than ten percent of the recruits finish basic training  The rest either resign  are expelled  or die in training  One of the chapters deals with Ted Hendrick  a fellow recruit and constant complainer who is flogged and expelled for striking a superior officer during a simulated combat exercise (he caught Sgt  Zim by surprise after being struck by the sergeant for failure to perform during the exercise)  Another recruit  a deserter who murdered a baby girl while AWOL  is hanged by his battalion after his arrest by civilian police and return to Camp Currie  Rico himself is flogged for poor handling of (simulated) nuclear weapons during a drill; despite these experiences he eventually graduates and is assigned to a unit in the Fleet  At some point during Rico training  the Bug War has changed from border incidents to formal war  and Rico finds himself taking part in combat operations  The war officially starts with an Arachnid attack that annihilates the city of Buenos Aires (which kills Juan mother who was visiting there)  although Rico makes it clear that prior to the attack there had been many 'incidents ' 'patrols ' or 'police actions ' Rico briefly describes the Terran Federation loss at the Battle of Klendathu during which his unit is decimated and his ship destroyed  Following Klendathu  the Terran Federation is reduced to making hit and run raids similar to the one described at the beginning of the novel (which  chronologically would be placed between chapters 10 and 11)  Rico meanwhile finds himself posted to Rasczak Roughnecks  This part of the book focuses on the daily routine of military life  as well as the relationship between officers and non commissioned officers  personified in this case by Rasczak and Sergeant Jelal  Eventually  Rico decides to become a career soldier  and one of his fellow troopers claims he is officer material and should consider volunteering for Officer Candidate School  He applies and is accepted  It turns out to be just like boot camp  only squared and cubed with books added  Rico manages to make it through to the final exam  in the Fleet  He is commissioned a temporary Third Lieutenant for his field test and commands his own unit during Operation Royalty  It is revealed at the end of the chapter that one of the enlisted men he leads into combat is his former basic training instructor  Sergeant Zim  Although personally convinced that he badly mismanaged his men  he passes the final exam  and graduates as a Second Lieutenant  There is also an account of the meeting between Rico and his father  who volunteered for Service after his wife  Rico mother  was killed at Buenos Aires  The final chapter serves as more of a coda  depicting Rico aboard the Rodger Young as the lieutenant in command of Rico Roughnecks  preparing to drop to Klendathu as part of a major strike  his father being his senior sergeant and a Native American Third Lieutenant in training (James Bearpaw  known as Jimmie) of his own under instruction ,1,0,0,0,0
283,The Lord of the Rings, Long before the events of the novel  the Dark Lord Sauron forges the One Ring to dominate the other Rings of Power and corrupt those who wear them: the leaders of Men  Elves and Dwarves  He is vanquished in battle by an alliance of Elves and Men  Isildur cuts the One Ring from Sauron finger  claiming it as an heirloom for his line  and Sauron loses his physical form  When Isildur is later ambushed and killed by Orcs  the Ring is lost in the River Anduin  Over two thousand years later  the Ring is found by a river dwelling hobbit called D√©agol  His friend Sm√©agol immediately falls under the Ring influence and strangles D√©agol to acquire it  Sm√©agol is banished and hides under the Misty Mountains  where the Ring extends his lifespan and transforms him over the course of hundreds of years into a twisted  corrupted creature called Gollum  He loses the Ring  his precious  and  as recounted in The Hobbit  Bilbo Baggins finds it  Meanwhile  Sauron reassumes physical form and takes back his old realm of Mordor  Gollum sets out in search of the Ring  but is captured by Sauron  who learns from him that Baggins now has it  Gollum is set loose  and Sauron  who needs the Ring to regain his full power  sends forth his powerful servants  the Nazg√ªl  to seize it  The novel begins in the Shire  where the Hobbit Frodo Baggins inherits the Ring from Bilbo  his cousin and guardian  Neither is aware of its origin  but Gandalf the Grey  a wizard and old friend of Bilbo  suspects the Ring identity  When he becomes certain  he strongly advises Frodo to take it away from the Shire  Frodo leaves  accompanied by his gardener and friend  Samwise (Sam) Gamgee  and two cousins  Meriadoc (Merry) Brandybuck and Peregrin (Pippin) Took  They nearly encounter the Nazg√ªl while still in the Shire  but shake off pursuit by cutting through the Old Forest  where they are aided by the enigmatic Tom Bombadil  who alone is unaffected by the Ring corrupting influence  After leaving the forest  they stop in the town of Bree where they meet Aragorn  Isildur heir  He persuades them to take him on as guide and protector  They flee from Bree after narrowly escaping another assault  but the Nazg√ªl follow and attack them on the hill of Weathertop  wounding Frodo with a Morgul blade  Aragorn leads the hobbits toward the Elven refuge of Rivendell  while Frodo gradually succumbs to the wound  The Ringwraiths nearly overtake Frodo at the Ford of Bruinen  but flood waters summoned by Elrond  master of Rivendell  rise up and overwhelm them  Frodo recovers in Rivendell under the care of Elrond  The Council of Elrond reveals much significant history about Sauron and the Ring  as well as the news that Sauron has corrupted Gandalf fellow wizard  Saruman  The Council decides that they must destroy the Ring  but that can only be done by returning it to the flames of Mount Doom in Mordor  where it was forged  Frodo volunteers to take on this daunting task  and a Fellowship of the Ring is formed to aid him: Sam  Merry  Pippin  Aragorn  Gandalf  Gimli the Dwarf  Legolas the Elf  and the Man Boromir  son of the Ruling Steward Denethor of the realm of Gondor  After a failed attempt to cross the Misty Mountains via the pass below Caradhras  the company are forced to try a more perilous path through the Mines of Moria  where they are attacked by the Watcher in the Water before the gate  Once inside  they discover the fate of Balin and his company of Dwarves  and realize their own danger  After repulsing an attack  they are pursued by orcs and an ancient  powerful Balrog  Gandalf confronts the Balrog  but in their struggle  both fall into a deep chasm  The others escape and take refuge in the Elven forest of Lothl√≥rien  where they are counselled by Galadriel and Celeborn  With boats and gifts from Galadriel  the company travel down the River Anduin to the hill of Amon Hen  Boromir succumbs to the lure of the Ring and attempts to take it from Frodo  Frodo escapes and determines to continue the quest alone  though Sam guesses his intent and comes along  Meanwhile  orcs sent by Saruman and Sauron kill Boromir and kidnap Merry and Pippin  After agonizing over which pair of hobbits to follow  Aragorn  Gimli and Legolas pursue the orcs bearing Merry and Pippin to Saruman  In the kingdom of Rohan  the orcs are slain by a

284,The Time Machine,The book protagonist is an English scientist and gentleman inventor living in Richmond  Surrey  identified by a narrator simply as the Time Traveller  The narrator recounts the Traveller lecture to his weekly dinner guests that time is simply a fourth dimension  and his demonstration of a tabletop model machine for travelling through it  He reveals that he has built a machine capable of carrying a person  and returns at dinner the following week to recount a remarkable tale  becoming the new narrator  In the new narrative  the Time Traveller tests his device with a journey that takes him to 802 701 A D   where he meets the Eloi  a society of small  elegant  childlike adults  They live in small communities within large and futuristic yet slowly deteriorating buildings  doing no work and having a frugivorous diet  His efforts to communicate with them are hampered by their lack of curiosity or discipline  and he speculates that they are a peaceful communist society  the result of humanity conquering nature with technology  and subsequently evolving to adapt to an environment in which strength and intellect are no longer advantageous to survival  Returning to the site where he arrived  the Time Traveller is shocked to find his time machine missing  and eventually works out that it has been dragged by some unknown party into a nearby structure with heavy doors  locked from the inside  which resembles a Sphinx  Later in the dark  he is approached menacingly by the Morlocks  ape like troglodytes who live in darkness underground and surface only at night  Within their dwellings he discovers the machinery and industry that makes the above ground paradise possible  He alters his theory  speculating that the human race has evolved into two species: the leisured classes have become the ineffectual Eloi  and the downtrodden working classes have become the brutish light fearing Morlocks  Deducing that the Morlocks have taken his time machine  he explores the Morlock tunnels  learning that they feed on the Eloi  His revised analysis is that their relationship is not one of lords and servants but of livestock and ranchers  The Time Traveller theorizes that intelligence is the result of and response to danger; with no real challenges facing either species  they have both lost the spirit  intelligence  and physical fitness of Man at its peak  Meanwhile  he saves an Eloi named Weena from drowning as none of the other Eloi take any notice of her plight  and they develop an innocently affectionate relationship over the course of several days  He takes Weena with him on an expedition to a distant structure that turns out to be the remains of a museum  where he finds a fresh supply of matches and fashions a crude weapon against Morlocks  whom he fears he must fight to get back his machine  He plans to take Weena back to his own time  Because the long and tiring journey back to Weena home is too much for them  they stop in the forest  and they are then overcome by Morlocks in the night  and Weena faints  The Traveller escapes only when a small fire he had left behind them to distract the Morlocks catches up to them as a forest fire; Weena is presumably lost in the fire  as are the Morlocks  The Morlocks use the time machine as bait to ensnare the Traveller  not understanding that he will use it to escape  He travels further ahead to roughly 30 million years from his own time  There he sees some of the last living things on a dying Earth  menacing reddish crab like creatures slowly wandering the blood red beaches chasing butterflies in a world covered in simple lichenous vegetation  He continues to make short jumps through time  seeing Earth rotation gradually cease and the sun grow larger  redder  and dimmer  and the world falling silent and freezing as the last degenerate living things die out  Overwhelmed  he returns to his laboratory  arriving just three hours after he originally left  Interrupting dinner  he relates his adventures to his disbelieving visitors  producing as evidence two strange flowers Weena had put in his pocket  The original narrator takes over and relates that he returned to the Time Traveller house the next day  finding him in final preparations for another journey  The Traveller promises to return in half an hour  but three years later  the narrator despairs of ever learning what became of him ,1,0,0,0,0
285,The Shockwave Rider,The novel is set in the weeks following Nick recapture after several years on the run  alternating between moral arguments with his interrogator  who is trying to discover why the program star pupil had absconded  and flashbacks of his career  The interrogator is Paul Freeman  a graduate of another secret installation known as Electric Skillet  which focuses on weapons and defense strategy  Although he initially felt at home at Tarnover  Nick eventually becomes aware of experiments in genetic engineering being performed there  These produce monstrous deformed children who are disposed of when they are no longer needed for study  At this point Nick becomes determined to escape  He studies data processing  steals a personal ID code intended for privileged individuals who wish to live their lives without surveillance  and goes on the run  He uses the stolen computer access code to cover his data trails and create new identities for himself  easily adopting entire new personas  One is the pastor of a popular church  another is an idle playboy gigolo  In this last role  calling himself Sandy Locke  he becomes the lover of Ina Grierson  a top executive at Ground to Space Industries  a powerful hypercorp known to all as G2S  Intending to use the computer facilities at G2S to ensure that his code is still valid after the six years he has been away  he signs on as a systems rationalizer with the company  This brings him into contact with Ina daughter  Kate  who attracts him despite her plain appearance and simple lifestyle  At the age of 22  Nick age when he left Tarnover  Kate is a perpetual student at UMKC  She is perceptive enough to penetrate Nick adopted persona  deeply disturbing him even though she fascinates him  He visits her at home  helping her to clean out some of her possessions  and meeting her tame cougar  Bagheera  Bagheera is the product of her late father genetic research into intelligence  He died shortly after abandoning the research because the government was using it to produce animals for military uses  The 21st century lifestyle produces a symptom called overload in many people  and most  including Nick  take tranquilizers to some degree  However Nick collapses completely when told that a representative from Tarnover is coming to meet him at G2S  He returns to Kate and confesses that he is not what he seems  asking for her help  She conducts him to one of the paid avoidance areas in California  where people are paid to do without the full panoply of modern technology  as an alternative to spending billions to rebuild infrastructure after the earthquake  After Nick risks exposure yet again in one of these places  they move to the least known one  a town called Precipice  Precipice turns out to be a Utopian community of a few thousand people  The nearest comparison would be an agrarian  cottage industry community designed by William Morris  Precipice is also the home of Hearing Aid  an anonymous telephone confession service accessible to anyone in the country  Hearing Aid is also known as the Ten Nines  after the phone number used to call it: 999 999 9999  People call the service and simply talk  Some rant  others seek sympathy  still others commit suicide while on the phone  Hearing Aid promise is that nobody else  not even the government  will hear the call  The only response Hearing Aid gives to a caller is Only I heard that  I hope it helped  Nick and Kate settle into the community  The inhabitants include intelligent dogs that escaped from the projects that Kate father worked on  These act as companions  guards  nannies  and even lie detectors  using their sense of smell  Nick rewrites the computer tapeworm that prevents the calls to Hearing Aid being monitored  While at G2S he became aware of massive backups of data being performed  clearly in anticipation of a major network outage  The Hearing Aid worm is designed to scramble network traffic if attacked  but Nick realizes that it could be destroyed if the authorities were prepared for the effects and ready to recover from them  His new worm  which he calls a phage  cannot be removed without dismantling the entire network  Possibly encouraged by the government  local gangs and tribes raid Precipice  burning down Nick and Kate house before being overwhelmed by the dogs  Nick  suffering another overload  blames Kate for the incident  since she  following Hearing Aid policy  cut off a call from someone attempting to warn Precipice  He hits her  and then  filled with remorse  leaves the town  He finally reveals his location to the authorities when  encountering one of the Roman circus operations which broadcast live fights and other bloody exhibitions to the country  he responds to an all comers challenge by the father of the leader of one of the gangs  and cripples him in front of a nationwide audience  At Tarnover  Paul Freeman takes charge of the interrogation  He was the representative whom Nick  as Sandy Locke  was supposed to meet at G2S  Freeman  a tall gaunt African American  gradually comes to realize that he has more sympathy with Nick views than his employer  and eventually absconds himself  giving Nick computer access so that Nick can make his own escape  The precipitating event in this case is Kate abduction by government agents  who bring her to Tarnover for further questioning and to threaten Nick  With the code he gets from Freeman  he sets up an identity as an Army Major  with Kate as his prisoner  Once clear of Tarnover  they disappear together  This time around  Nick has another plan  and rather than running and hiding  he and Kate spend a number of months traveling the country  aided by an invisible college' of academics who are allies or former residents of Precipice  He creates a new worm which is designed to destroy all secrecy  (Brunner invented the term worm for this program  as a self replicating program that propagates across a computer network   the term worm was later adopted by computer researchers as the name for this type of program ) The worm is eventually activated  and the details of all the government dark secrets (clandestine genetic experimentation that produces crippled children  bribes and kickbacks from corporations  concealed crimes of high public officials) now become accessible from anywhere on the network   in fact  those most affected by a particular crime of a government official are emailed the full details  In place of the old system  Nick has designed the worm to enforce a kind of utilitarian socialism  with people worth being defined by their roles in society  not their connections in high places  In effect  the network becomes the entire government and financial system  policing income for illegal money  freezing the accounts of criminals  while making sure money (or credit) flows to places where people are in need  This will only happen fully if the results of a plebiscite  again conducted over the network  allow it  In a final atavistic attempt at revenge  the government orders a nuclear strike by a single aircraft from a local Air Force base  Warned by Hearing Aid  Nick is able to penetrate the military computers and manufacture a counter order to stop the plane just before it reaches the town  The book ends optimistically  with there being no more privileged hiding of information  no more secret conspiracies of the rich and powerful ,1,0,0,0,0
286,Mort, As a teenager  Mort had a personality and temperament that made him rather unsuited to the family farming business  Mort father  named Lezek  felt that Mort thought too much  which prevented him from achieving anything practical  Thus  Lezek took him to a local hiring fair  hoping that Mort would land an apprenticeship with some tradesman; not only would this provide a job for his son  but it would also make his son propensity towards thinking someone else problem  At the job fair  Mort at first has no luck attracting the interest of an employer  Then  just before the stroke of midnight  a man concealed in a black cloak arrives on a white horse  He says he is looking for a young man to assist him in his work and selects Mort for the job  The man turns out to be Death  and Mort is given an apprenticeship in ushering souls into the next world (though his father thinks he is been apprenticed to an undertaker)  When it is a princess' time to die (according to a preconceived reality)  Mort  instead of ushering her soul  saves her from death  dramatically altering a part of the Discworld reality  However  the princess  for whom Mort has a developing infatuation  does not have long to live  and he must try to save her  once again  from a seemingly unstoppable death  Both the princess and Mort end up consulting the local wizard  Igneous Cutwell  for various methods of assistance with the crisis  As Mort begins to do most of Death Duty  he loses some of his former character traits  and essentially starts to become more like Death himself  Death  in turn  yearns to relish what being human is truly like and travels to Ankh Morpork to indulge in new experiences and attempt to feel real human emotion  Conclusively  Mort must duel Death for Mort freedom  Though Death wins the duel  he spares Mort life and sends him back to the Disc  The princess is saved from a second death when the alternate reality Mort created is reduced to a pearl like state  This pearl is given to Mort for safe keeping  At the end of the novel  Mort marries Ysabell  Death adopted daughter ,1,0,0,0,0

288,The Great Divorce, The narrator inexplicably finds himself in a grim and joyless city  the grey town  which is either hell or purgatory depending on how long one stays there  He eventually finds a bus for those who desire an excursion to some other place (and which eventually turns out to be the foothills of heaven)  He enters the bus and converses with his fellow passengers as they travel  When the bus reaches its destination  the passengers on the bus &mdash; including the narrator &mdash; are gradually revealed to be ghosts  Although the country is the most beautiful they have ever seen  every feature of the landscape (including streams of water and blades of grass) is unyieldingly solid compared to themselves: it causes them immense pain to walk on the grass  and even a single leaf is far too heavy for any to lift  Shining figures  men and women whom they have known on earth  come to meet them  and to urge them to repent and enter heaven proper  They promise that as the ghosts travel onward and upward  they will become more solid and thus feel less and less discomfort  These figures  called spirits to distinguish them from the ghosts  offer to assist them in the journey toward the mountains and the sunrise  Almost all of the ghosts choose to return instead to the grey town  giving various reasons and excuses  Much of the interest of the book lies in the recognition it awakens of the plausibility and familiarity  along with the thinness and self deception  of the excuses that the ghosts refuse to abandon  even though to do so would bring them to reality and joy forevermore  The narrator is met by the writer George MacDonald  whom he hails as his mentor  just as Dante did when encountering Virgil in the Divine Comedy; and MacDonald becomes the narrator guide in his journey  just as Virgil became Dante  MacDonald explains that it is possible for a soul to choose to remain in heaven despite having been in the grey town; for such souls  the goodness of heaven will work backwards into their lives  turning even their worst sorrows into joy  and changing their experience on earth to an extension of heaven  Conversely  the evil of hell works so that if a soul remains in  or returns to  the grey town  even its happiness on earth will lose its meaning  and its experience on earth would have been hell  None of the ghosts realize that the grey town is  in fact  hell  Indeed it is not that much different from the life they led on earth: joyless  friendless  and uncomfortable  It just goes on forever  and gets worse and worse  with some characters whispering their fear of the night that is eventually to come  According to MacDonald  while it is possible to leave hell and enter heaven  doing so implies turning away (repentance); or as depicted by Lewis  embracing ultimate and unceasing joy itself  In answer to the narrator question MacDonald confirms that what is going on is a dream  The use of chess imagery as well as the correspondence of dream elements to elements in the narrator waking life is reminiscent of Alice Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass  The narrator discovers that the vast grey town and its ghostly inhabitants are minuscule to the point of being invisible compared with the immensity of heaven and reality  This is illustrated in the encounter of the blessed woman and her husband: she is surrounded by gleaming attendants while he shrinks down to invisibility as he uses a collared tragedian to speak for him  Toward the end  the narrator expresses the terror and agony of remaining a ghost in the advent of full daybreak in heaven  comparing the experience to having large blocks fall on one body (at this point falling books awaken him)  This parallels that of the man with his dream of judgment day in the House of the Interpreter of The Pilgrim Progress  The book ends with the narrator awakening from his dream of heaven into the unpleasant reality of wartime Britain  in conscious imitation of The Pilgrim Progress  the last sentence of the First Part of which is: So I awoke  and behold  it was a Dream ,0,1,0,0,0
289,The Screwtape Letters,In The Screwtape Letters  C S  Lewis provides a series of lessons in the importance of taking a deliberate role in living out Christian faith by portraying a typical human life  with all its temptations and failings  as seen from devils' viewpoints  Screwtape holds an administrative post in the bureaucracy (Lowerarchy) of Hell  and acts as a mentor to Wormwood  the inexperienced tempter  In the body of the thirty one letters which make up the book  Screwtape gives Wormwood detailed advice on various methods of undermining faith and promoting sin in the Patient  interspersed with observations on human nature and Christian doctrine  Wormwood and Screwtape live in a peculiarly morally reversed world  where individual benefit and greed are seen as the greatest good  and neither demon is capable of comprehending God love for man or acknowledging true human virtue when he sees it  Versions of the letters were originally published weekly in the Anglican periodical The Guardian between May and November 1941  and the standard edition contains an introduction explaining how the author chose to write his story  Lewis wrote the sequel Screwtape Proposes a Toast in 1959  a critique of certain trends in public education (state schooling)  An omnibus edition with a new preface by Lewis was published by Bles in 1961 and MacMillan in 1962  The Screwtape Letters is one of Lewis' most popular works  although he claimed that it was not fun to write  and resolved never to write another 'Letter'  Both The Screwtape Letters and Screwtape Proposes a Toast have been released on both audio cassette and CD  with narration by John Cleese and Joss Ackland  A dramatized audio version by Focus on the Family was a 2010 Audie Award finalist ,0,1,0,0,0
290,Tunnel in the Sky,A Malthusian catastrophe on Earth has been averted by the invention of teleportation  called the Ramsbotham jump  which is used to send Earth excess population to colonize other planets  However  the costs of operating the device mean that the colonies are isolated from Earth until they can justify two way travel  Because modern technology requires a supporting infrastructure  more primitive methods are employed ‚Äî for example  horses instead of tractors (because tractors cannot reproduce themselves)  Rod Walker is a high school student who dreams of becoming a professional colonist  The final test of his Advanced Survival class is to stay alive on an unfamiliar planet for between two and ten days  Students may team up and equip themselves with whatever gear they can carry  but are otherwise completely on their own  They are told only that the challenges are neither insurmountable nor unreasonable  On test day  each student walks through the Ramsbotham portal and finds him or herself alone on a strange planet  though reasonably close to the pickup point  Rod  acting on advice  chooses to equip himself with hunting knives and basic survival gear rather than high tech weaponry  on the grounds that the latter is dependent on the infrastructure required to maintain it and can easily become a crutch  The last advice the students receive is to watch out for stobor  On the second day  Rod is ambushed and knocked unconscious by a thief  When he wakes up  all he has left is a spare knife hidden under a bandage  In his desperate concentration on survival  he loses track of time  Eventually he teams up with Jacqueline Jack Daudet  a student from another class whom he initially mistakes for a male  When she tells him that more than ten days have elapsed without contact  he realizes that they are stranded  They start recruiting others for the long haul and Rod becomes the de facto leader of a community that eventually grows to around 75 people  Rod has no taste for politics or administration  and is happy to have Grant Cowper  an older college student and born politician  elected mayor  Grant proves to be much better at talking than getting things done  Despite disagreeing with many of Grant policies  Rod supports him  Grant ignores Rod warning that they are living in a dangerously hard to defend location and that they should move to a cave system he has found  When a species previously thought harmless suddenly changes its behavior and stampedes through their camp  the settlement is devastated and Grant is killed  Rod is subsequently put back in charge  Heinlein tracks the social development of this community of educated Westerners deprived of technology  followed by its abrupt dissolution when contact with Earth is reestablished  After nearly two years of isolation  the culture shock experienced by the survivors highlights for them  and the reader  the pain and uncertainty of becoming an adult  by reversing the process abruptly    Each of the students goes from being a personally self responsible member of an autonomous community back to being a youth with little authority or responsibility in the home culture  All of the students go back willingly except for Rod  who has great difficulty reverting from the status of head of a small  but sovereign state to a teenager casually brushed aside by the adult rescuers  However  his teacher (and now brother in law) and his sister persuade him to change his mind  His teacher also informs Rod that his warning against stobor (robots spelled backwards) was just a way of personalizing the dangers of an unknown planet   to instill fear and caution in the students  Years later  Rod is briefly depicted accomplishing his heart desire; the novel ending finds him preparing to lead a formal colonization party to another planet ,1,0,0,0,0
291,The Fountains of Paradise,In the 22nd century  Dr Vannevar Morgan is a famous structural engineer who hopes to develop the pace elevator' from a theoretical concept to reality and enlists the resources of his employers to carry out experiments  But the only suitable starting point (Earth station) for the elevator lies at the summit of a mountain in Taprobane occupied by an ancient order of Buddhist monks  who implacably oppose the plan  Morgan is approached by a Mars based consortium to develop the elevator on Mars as part of a massive terraforming project  To demonstrate the viability of the technology  Morgan tries to run a thin cable of ‚Äòhyperfilament‚Äô from an orbital factory down to ground level at Taprobane  A monk at the monastery  a former astrophysicist who is a mathematical genius  tries to sabotage the attempt by creating an artificial hurricane using a hijacked weather control satellite  His attempt is in fact successful  but in an ironic twist  the hurricane blows butterflies to the peak of the mountain  This fulfills an ancient prophecy that causes the monks to leave the mountain  The tower can be built on Earth after all  Forced to resign his position for acting beyond his authority  Morgan joins the Martian consortium named 'Astroengineering' and construction of the Tower commences  Several years later  the Earth based tower is well under construction and travel up and down &mdash; both for tourists and for transfer to rocket ships &mdash; is being trialled  An astrophysicist and a group of his students and tower staff are stranded in an emergency chamber six hundred kilometres up after an accident with their transport capsule  They have limited food and air supplies  Whilst a laser on a weather control satellite is able to supply heat  it is imperative to provide them with filter masks against the increasing carbon dioxide and also with food  air  and medical supplies (a theme earlier explored in Clarke novel The Sands of Mars)  Despite his rapidly failing health  Morgan asserts his right to travel up the tower in a one man pider' to rescue them  He nearly fails  with limited battery power  but ultimately succeeds in reaching the chamber  As Morgan surveys the progress of his brainchild  his heart disease claims his life  A short epilogue envisages Earth many centuries later  after the sun has cooled and Earth has been depopulated  with humans now living on the terraformed inner planets  Several space elevators lead to a giant circumterran space station that encircles Earth at geostationary altitude  The analogy with a wheel is evident: the space station itself is the wheel rim  Earth is the axle  and the six equidistant space elevators the spokes ,1,0,0,0,0

293,2010: Odyssey Two,The story is set nine years after the failure of the Discovery One mission to Jupiter  A joint Soviet American crew  including Heywood Floyd from 2001  on the Soviet spaceship Alexei Leonov (named after the famous cosmonaut) arrives to discover what went wrong with the earlier mission  to investigate the monolith in orbit around the planet  and to resolve the disappearance of David Bowman  They hypothesize that much of this information is locked away on the now abandoned Discovery One  The Soviets have an advanced new Sakharov drive which will propel them to Jupiter ahead of the American Discovery Two  so Floyd is assigned to the Leonov crew  However  a Chinese space station rockets out of Earth orbit  revealing itself to be the interplanetary spacecraft Tsien  also aimed at Jupiter  The Leonov crewmembers think the Chinese are on a one way trip due to its speed  but Floyd surmises that due to the large water content of Europa they intend to land there and use the water content to refuel  The Tsien daring mission ends in failure  when it is destroyed by an indigenous life form on Europa  The only survivor radios the story to the Leonov; it is presumed that he dies when his spacesuit air supply runs out  The Leonov survives a dangerous aerobraking around Jupiter and arrives at Discovery  Mission crewmember and HAL 9000 creator  Dr  Chandra  reactivates the computer to ascertain the cause of his earlier aberrant behavior  After some time  Floyd is speaking to a Russian on board  who  for an instant  sees the Monolith open again  into a Stargate  as David Bowman escapes from the Monolith universe back into ours  A sequence of scenes follows the explorations of David Bowman  who has been transformed into a non corporeal  energy based life form  much like the aliens controlling the monoliths  During his journey  the Avatar of Bowman travels to Earth  making contact with significant individuals from his human past: He visits his mother and brushes her hair (shortly before she dies)  and he appears to his ex girlfriend on her television screen  In the novel  the aliens are using Bowman as a probe to learn about humankind  He then returns to the Jupiter system to explore beneath the ice of Europa  where he finds aquatic life forms  and under the clouds of Jupiter  where he discovers gaseous life forms  Both are primitive  but the aliens deem the Europan creatures to have evolutionary potential  An apparition of Bowman appears before Floyd  warning him that they must leave Jupiter within 15 days  Floyd has difficulty convincing the rest of the crew at first  but then the monolith vanishes from orbit and a mysterious dark spot appears on Jupiter and begins to grow  HAL telescope observations reveal that the Great Black Spot is  in fact  a vast population of monoliths  increasing at an exponential rate  which appear to be eating the planet  The Leonov crew devises a plan to use the Discovery as a booster rocket  enabling them to return to Earth ahead of schedule  Unfortunately  HAL and the Discovery will be trapped in Jupiter orbit  with insufficient fuel to escape  The crew are worried that HAL will have the same neuroses on discovering that he will be abandoned yet again  so Chandra must convince HAL that the human crew is in danger  The Leonov crew flees Jupiter as the swarm of monoliths spread to engulf the planet  By acting as self replicating 'von Neumann' machines  these monoliths increase Jupiter density until the planet achieves nuclear fusion  becoming a small star  In the novel  this obliterates the primitive life forms inhabiting the Jovian atmosphere  which the Monoliths' controllers had deemed less worthy than the aquatic life of Europa  As Jupiter is about to transform  Bowman returns to Discovery to give HAL a last order to carry out  HAL begins repeatedly broadcasting the message The creation of the new star  which Earth eventually names Lucifer  destroys Discovery  However  in appreciation for HAL help  Bowman has the aliens which control the monoliths remove HAL artificial intelligence from Discoverys computer core and transform him into the same kind of life form as David Bowman  and becomes his companion  The book ends with a brief epilogue  which takes place in AD 20 001  By this time  the Europans have evolved into a species that has developed a primitive civilization  most likely with assistance from a monolith  They are not described in detail  though they are said to have tendril like limbs  They regard the star Lucifer (formerly the planet Jupiter) as their primary Sun  referring to ours as The Cold Sun  Though their settlements are concentrated primarily in the hemisphere of Europa which is constantly bathed in Lucifer rays  some Europans have begun in recent generations to explore the Farside  the hemisphere facing away from Lucifer  which is still covered in ice  There they may witness the spectacle of night  unknown on the other side of Europa  when the Cold Sun sets  The Europans who explore the Farside have been carefully observing the night sky and have begun to develop a mythology based on their observations  They correctly believe that Lucifer was not always there  They believe that the Cold Sun was its brother and was condemned to march around the sky for a crime  The Europans also see three other major bodies in the sky  One seems to be constantly engulfed in fire  and the other two have lights on them which are gradually spreading  These three bodies are the moons Io  Callisto  and Ganymede  the latter two of which are presently being colonized by humans  Humans have been attempting to explore Europa ever since Lucifer was created in 2010  However  none of these attempts has been successful  Every probe that has attempted to land on Europa has been destroyed in the atmosphere; as it is later shown in 2061 and 3001 manned spacecraft that attempt to land have been instead diverted by an external force  The debris from every probe falls to the surface of the planet  and the debris from some of the first ships to be destroyed is venerated by the Europans  Finally  there is a Monolith on the planet  which is worshipped by the Europans more than anything else  The Europans assume  correctly  that the Monolith is what keeps humans at bay  Dave Bowman and HAL lie dormant in this Monolith  The Monolith is the guardian of Europa  and will continue to prevent contact between humans and Europans for as long as it sees fit ,1,0,0,0,0
294,Brave New World,The novel opens in London in 632 (AD 2540 in the Gregorian Calendar)  The vast majority of the population is unified under the World State  an eternally peaceful  stable global society in which goods and resources are plentiful (because the population is permanently limited to no more than two billion people) and everyone is happy  Natural reproduction has been done away with and children are created  'decanted' and raised in Hatcheries and Conditioning Centres  where they are divided into five castes (which are further split into 'Plus' and 'Minus' members) and designed to fulfill predetermined positions within the social and economic strata of the World State  Fetuses chosen to become members of the highest caste  'Alpha'  are allowed to develop naturally while maturing to term in decanting bottles  while fetuses chosen to become members of the lower castes ('Beta'  'Gamma'  'Delta'  'Epsilon') are subjected to in situ chemical interference to cause arrested development in intelligence or physical growth  Each 'Alpha' or 'Beta' is the product of one unique fertilized egg developing into one unique fetus  Members of lower castes are not unique but are instead created using the Bokanovsky process which enables a single egg to spawn (at the point of the story being told) up to 96 children and one ovary to produce thousands of children  To further increase the birthrate of Gammas  Deltas and Epsilons  Podsnap Technique causes all the eggs in the ovary to mature simultaneously  allowing the hatchery to get full use of the ovary in two years' time  People of these castes make up the majority of human society  and the production of such specialized children bolsters the efficiency and harmony of society  since these people are deliberately limited in their cognitive and physical abilities  as well as the scope of their ambitions and the complexity of their desires  thus rendering them easier to control  All children are educated via the hypnopaedic process  which provides each child with caste appropriate subconscious messages to mold the child lifelong self image and social outlook to that chosen by the leaders and their predetermined plans for producing future adult generations  To maintain the World State Command Economy for the indefinite future  all citizens are conditioned from birth to value consumption with such platitudes as ending is better than mending  more stiches less riches i e   buy a new item instead of fixing the old one  because constant consumption  and near universal employment to meet society material demands  is the bedrock of economic and social stability for the World State  Beyond providing social engagement and distraction in the material realm of work or play  the need for transcendence  solitude and spiritual communion is addressed with the ubiquitous availability and universally endorsed consumption of the drug soma  Soma is an allusion to a mythical drink of the same name consumed by ancient Indo Aryans  In the book  soma is a hallucinogen that takes users on enjoyable  hangover free holidays  It was developed by the World State to provide these inner directed personal experiences within a socially managed context of State run 'religious' organizations; social clubs  The hypnopaedically inculcated affinity for the State produced drug  as a self medicating comfort mechanism in the face of stress or discomfort  thereby eliminates the need for religion or other personal allegiances outside or beyond the World State  Recreational sex is an integral part of society  According to the World State  sex is a social activity  rather than a means of reproduction (sex is encouraged from early childhood)  The few women who can reproduce are conditioned to use birth control  even wearing a Malthusian belt (which resembles a cartridge belt and holds the regulation supply of contraceptives) as a popular fashion accessory  The maxim everyone belongs to everyone else is repeated often  and the idea of a family is considered pornographic; sexual competition and emotional  romantic relationships are rendered obsolete because they are no longer needed  Marriage  natural birth  parenthood  and pregnancy are considered too obscene to be mentioned in casual conversation  Thus  society has developed a new idea of reproductive comprehension  Spending time alone is considered an outrageous waste of time and money  and wanting to be an individual is horrifying  Conditioning trains people to consume and never to enjoy being alone  so by spending an afternoon not playing Obstacle Golf  or not in bed with a friend  one is forfeiting acceptance  In the World State  people typically die at age 60 having maintained good health and youthfulness their whole life  Death isn't feared; anyone reflecting upon it is reassured by the knowledge that everyone is happy  and that society goes on  Since no one has family  they have no ties to mourn  The conditioning system eliminates the need for professional competitiveness; people are literally bred to do their jobs and cannot desire another  There is no competition within castes; each caste member receives the same food  housing  and soma rationing as every other member of that caste  There is no desire to change one caste  largely because a person sleep conditioning reinforces each individual place in the caste system  To grow closer with members of the same class  citizens participate in mock religious services called Solidarity Services  in which twelve people consume large quantities of soma and sing hymns  The ritual progresses through group hypnosis and climaxes in an orgy  In geographic areas nonconducive to easy living and consumption  securely contained groups of savages are left to their own devices  These appear to be similar to the reservations of land established for the Native American population during the colonisation of North America  These avages' are beholden of strange customs  including self mutilation and religion  a mere curio in the outside world  In its first chapters  the novel describes life in the World State as wonderful and introduces Lenina Crowne and Bernard Marx  Lenina  a hatchery worker  is socially accepted and comfortable with her place in society  while Bernard  a psychologist  is an outcast  Although an Alpha Plus  Bernard is shorter in stature than the average of his caste‚Äîa quality shared by the lower castes  which gives him an inferiority complex  His work with sleep teaching has led him to realize that what others believe to be their own deeply held beliefs are merely phrases repeated to children while they are asleep  Still  he recognizes the necessity of such programming as the reason why his society meets the emotional needs of its citizens  Courting disaster  he is vocal about being different  once stating he dislikes soma because he'd rather be himself  Bernard differences fuel rumors that he was accidentally administered alcohol while incubated  a method used to keep Epsilons short  Bernard only friend is Helmholtz Watson  an Alpha Plus lecturer at the College of Emotional Engineering (Department of Writing)  The friendship is based on their similar experiences as misfits  but unlike Bernard  Watson sense of loneliness stems from being too gifted  too intelligent  too handsome  and too physically strong  Helmholtz is drawn to Bernard as a confidant: he can talk to Bernard about his desire to write poetry  Bernard is on holiday at a Savage Reservation  The reservation  located in New Mexico  consists of a community named Malpais  From afar  Lenina thinks it will be exciting  In person  she finds the aged  toothless natives who mend their clothes rather than throw them away repugnant  and the situation is made worse when she discovers that she has left her soma tablets at the resort hotel  In typical tourist fashion  Bernard and Lenina watch what at first appears to be a quaint native ceremony  The village folk  whose culture resembles the contemporary Indian groups of the region  descendants of the Anasazi  including the Puebloan peoples of Acoma  Laguna  and Zuni  and the Ramah Navajo  begin by singing  but the ritual quickly becomes a passion play where a village boy is whipped to unconsciousness  Soon after  the couple encounters Linda  a woman who has been living in Malpais since she came on a trip and became separated from her group  among whom was a man to whom she refers as Tomakin but who is revealed to be Bernard boss  the Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning  Thomas  She became pregnant despite adhering to her Malthusian Drill and there were no facilities for an abortion  Her shame at pregnancy was so great that she decided not to return to her old life  but to stay with the savages  Linda gave birth to a son  John (later referred to as John the Savage) who is now 18  Conversations with Linda and John reveal that their life has been hard  For 18 years  they have been treated as outsiders: the native men treated Linda like a sex object while the native women regularly beat and ostracized her because of her promiscuity  and John was mistreated and excluded for his mother actions and the color of his skin  John was angered by Linda lovers  and even attacked one in a jealous rage while a child  John one joy was that his mother had taught him to read  although he only had two books: a scientific manual from his mother job  which he called a beastly  beastly book  and a collection of Shakespeare works (which have been banned in the World State for being subversive)  Shakespeare gives John articulation to his feelings  though  and he especially is interested in Othello  Romeo and Juliet  and Hamlet  At the same time  John has been denied the religious rituals of the village  although he has watched them and even has had some religious experiences on his own in the desert  Old  weathered and tired  Linda wants to return to her familiar world in London  as she misses living in the city and taking soma  John wants to see the brave new world his mother has told him so much about  Bernard wants to take them back to block Thomas from his plan to reassign Bernard to Iceland as punishment for his asocial beliefs  Bernard arranges permission for Linda and John to leave the reservation  John also seems to have an attraction to Lenina  as while Bernard is away  getting the permission to move the savages  he finds her suitcase and ruffles through all of her clothes  taking in the smells  He then sees her sleeping and stares at her  thinking all he has to do to see her properly is undo one zip  He later tells himself off for being like this towards Lenina  and seems to be extremely shy around her  Upon his return to London  Bernard is confronted by Thomas  the Director of the Hatchery and Conditioning Centre who  in front of an audience of higher caste Centre workers  denounces Bernard for his asocial behavior  Bernard  thinking that for the first time in his life he has the upper hand  defends himself by presenting the Director with his long lost lover and unknown son  Linda and John  John falls to his knees and calls Thomas his father  which causes an uproar of laughter  The humiliated Director resigns in shame  Spared from reassignment  Bernard makes John the toast of London  Pursued by the highest members of society  able to bed any woman he fancies  Bernard revels in attention he once scorned  The victory  however  is short lived  Linda  decrepit  toothless  and friendless  goes on a permanent soma holiday while John  appalled by what he perceives to be an empty society  refuses to attend Bernard parties  Society drops Bernard as swiftly as it had taken him  Bernard turns to the person he'd believed to be his one true friend  only to see Helmholtz fall into a quick  easy camaraderie with John  Bernard is left an outcast yet again as he watches the only two men with whom he ever connected find more of interest in each other than they ever did in him  John and Helmholtz island of peace is brief  Lenina tries to seduce John  but John pushes her away  calling her out on her sexually wanton ways  Whilst Lenina is in the bathroom  humiliated and putting her clothes on  John receives a telephone call from the hospital telling him that his mother is extremely unwell  He rushes over to see her and sits at her bedside  trying to get her out of her soma holiday so that he can talk to her  He is heartbroken when his mother succumbs to soma and dies  He is extremely annoyed by the young boys that enter the ward to be conditioned about death and annoy John to the point where he starts to use violence to send them away  John grief bewilders and revolts the hospital workers  and their lack of reaction to Linda death prompts John to try to force humanity from the workers by throwing their soma rations out a window  The ensuing riot brings the police  who quell the riot by filling the room with soma  Bernard and Helmholtz arrive to help John  but only Helmholtz helps him  while Bernard stands to the side  torn between risking involvement by helping or escaping the scene  Following the riot  Bernard  Helmholtz and John are brought before Mustapha Mond  the Resident World Controller for Western Europe  Bernard (who breaks down during the middle of the conversation) and Helmholtz are told they will be exiled to islands of their choice  Mond explains that this exile is not so much a threat to force freethinkers to reform and rejoin society as it is a chance for them to act as they please because they will not be able to influence the population  He also divulges that he too once risked banishment to an island because of some scientific experiments that were deemed controversial by the state  giving insight into his sympathetic tone  Helmholtz chooses the Falkland Islands  believing that their terrible weather will inspire his writing  but Bernard simply does not want to leave London; he struggles with Mond and is thrown out of the office  After Bernard and Helmholtz have left  Mustapha and John engage in a philosophical argument on the morals behind the existing society and then John is told the experiment will continue and he will not be sent to an island  John meets with Bernard and Helmholtz once again before their departures from London and Bernard apologizes to John for his opportunistic behavior  having come to terms with his imminent exile and having restored his friendship with Helmholtz  In the final chapter  John isolates himself from society in a lighthouse outside London where he finds his hermit life interrupted from mourning his mother by the more bitter memories of civilization  To atone  John brutally whips himself in the open  a ritual the Indians in his own village had denied him  His self flagellation  caught on film and shown publicly  destroys his hermit life  Hundreds of gawking sightseers  intrigued by John violent behavior  fly out to watch the savage in person  Even Lenina comes to watch  crying a tear John does not see  The sight of the woman whom he both adores and blames is too much for him; John attacks and whips her  This sight of genuine  unbridled emotion drives the crowd wild with excitement  and ‚Äî handling it as they are conditioned to ‚Äî they turn on each other  in a frenzy of beating and chanting that devolves into a mass orgy of soma and sex  In the morning  John  hopeless  alone  horrified by his drug use and the orgy in which he participated that countered his beliefs  makes one last attempt to escape civilization and atone  When thousands of gawking sightseers arrive that morning  frenzied at the prospect of seeing the savage perform again  they find John dead from a suicidal hanging ,1,0,0,0,0
295,Aeneid,The Aeneid can be divided into two halves based on the disparate subject matter of Books 1‚Äì6 (Aeneas' journey to Latium in Italy) and Books 7‚Äì12 (the war in Latium)  These two halves are commonly regarded as reflecting Virgil ambition to rival Homer by treating both the Odyssey wandering theme and the Iliads warfare themes  This is  however  a rough correspondence  the limitations of which should be borne in mind  Virgil begins his poem with a statement of his theme (Arma virumque cano&nbsp;     I sing of arms and of a man&nbsp;   ) and an invocation to the Muse  falling some seven lines after the poem inception: (Musa  mihi causas memora&nbsp;     O Muse  recount to me the causes&nbsp;   )  He then explains the reason for the principal conflict in the story: the resentment held by the goddess Juno against the Trojan people  This is consistent with her role throughout the Homeric epics  Also in the manner of Homer  the story proper begins in medias res  with the Trojan fleet in the eastern Mediterranean  heading in the direction of Italy  The fleet  led by Aeneas  is on a voyage to find a second home  It has been foretold that in Italy  he will give rise to a race both noble and courageous  a race which will become known to all nations  Juno is wrathful  because she had not been chosen in the judgment of Paris  and because her favorite city  Carthage  will be destroyed by Aeneas' descendants  Also  Ganymede  a Trojan prince  was chosen to be her husband Jupiter cup bearer‚Äîreplacing Juno daughter Hebe  Juno proceeds to Aeolus  King of the Winds  and asks that he release the winds to stir up a storm in exchange for a bribe (Deiopea  the loveliest of all her sea nymphs  as a wife)  Despite refusing her bribe  he agrees  and the storm devastates the fleet  Neptune takes notice: although he himself is no friend of the Trojans  he is infuriated by Juno intrusion into his domain  and stills the winds and calms the waters  after making sure that Aeolus would not try again  The fleet takes shelter on the coast of Africa  There  Aeneas mother  Venus  in the form of a hunting woman very similar to the goddess Diana  encourages him and tells him the history of the city  Eventually  Aeneas ventures in  and in the temple of Juno  seeks and gains the favor of Dido  Queen of Carthage  the city which has only recently been founded by refugees from Tyre and which will later become one of Rome greatest imperial rivals and enemies  At a banquet given in the honour of the Trojans  Aeneas recounts sadly the events which occasioned the Trojans' fortuitous arrival  He begins the tale shortly after the events described in the Iliad  Crafty Ulysses devised a way for Greek warriors to gain entry into Troy by hiding in a large wooden horse  The Greeks pretended to sail away  leaving a man  Sinon  to tell the Trojans that the horse was an offering and that if it were taken into the city  the Trojans would be able to conquer Greece  The Trojan priest Laoco√∂n  who had seen through the Greek plot and urged the horse destruction  hurled his spear at the wooden horse  Just after  in what would be seen by the Trojans as punishment from the gods  Laoco√∂n was suddenly grabbed and eaten  along with his two sons  by two giant sea snakes  So the Trojans brought the horse inside the fortified walls  and after nightfall the armed Greeks emerged and began to slaughter the city inhabitants  Aeneas woke up and saw with horror what was happening to his beloved city  At first he tried to fight against the enemy  but soon he lost his comrades and was left alone to fend off tens of Greeks  Hector  the fallen Trojan prince  had told him in a dream to flee with his family  Aeneas tells of his escape with his son Ascanius and father Anchises after various omens (his son Ascanius' head catches fire without his being harmed  and then a shooting star)  his wife Creusa having been separated from the others and subsequently killed in the general catastrophe  After getting outside Troy  he goes back for his wife  Her ghost appears before him and tells him that his destiny is to found Rome  He tells of how  rallying the other survivors  he built a fleet of ships and made landfall at various locations in the Mediterranean: Thrace  where they find the last remains of a fellow Trojan  Polydorus; The Strophades  where they encounter the Harpy Celaeno; Crete  which they believe to be the land where they are to build their city (but they are set straight by Apollo); and Buthrotum  This last city had been built in an attempt to replicate Troy  In Buthrotum  Aeneas met Andromache  the widow of Hector  She still laments for the loss of her valiant husband and beloved child  There  too  Aeneas saw and met Helenus  one of Priam sons  who had the gift of prophecy  Through him  Aeneas learned the destiny laid out for him: he was divinely advised to seek out the land of Italy (also known as Ausonia or Hesperia)  where his descendants would not only prosper  but in time rule the entire known world  In addition  Helenus also bade him go to the Sibyl in Cumae  Heading out into the open sea  Aeneas left Buthrotum  rounding Italy cape and making his way towards Sicily (Trinacria)  There  they are caught in the whirlpool of Charybdis and driven out to sea  Soon they come ashore at the land of the Cyclops  There they meet a Greek  Achaemenides  one of Ulysses' men  who had been left behind when his comrades escaped the cave of Polyphemus  They take Achaemenides onboard and narrowly escape Polyphemus  Shortly after these events  Anchises dies peacefully of old age  Meanwhile  Venus has her own plans  She goes to her son  Aeneas' half brother Cupid  and tells him to imitate Ascanius  Disguised as such  he goes to Dido  and offers the gifts expected from a guest  With her motherly love revived in the presence of the boy  her heart is pierced and she falls in love with the boy and his father  During the banquet  Dido realizes that she has fallen madly in love with Aeneas  although she had previously sworn fidelity to the soul of her late husband  Sychaeus  who had been murdered by her brother Pygmalion  Juno seizes upon this opportunity to make a deal with Venus  Aeneas' mother  with the intention of distracting him from his destiny of founding a city in Italy  Aeneas is inclined to return Dido love  and during a hunting expedition  a storm drives them into a cave in which Aeneas and Dido presumably have sex  an event that Dido takes to indicate a marriage between them  But when Jupiter sends Mercury to remind Aeneas of his duty  he has no choice but to part  Her heart broken  Dido commits suicide by stabbing herself upon a pyre with Aeneas' sword  Before dying  she predicts eternal strife between Aeneas people and hers; rise up from my bones  avenging spirit (4 625  trans  Fitzgerald) is an obvious invocation to Hannibal  Looking back from the deck of his ship  Aeneas sees Dido funeral pyre smoke and knows its meaning only too clearly  However  destiny calls and the Trojan fleet sails on to Italy  Book 5 takes place on Sicily and centers on the funeral games that Aeneas organizes for the anniversary of his father death  Aeneas and his men have left Carthage for Sicily where  one year after the death of his father  Aeneas organizes a nine day anniversary which includes celebratory games‚Äìa boat race  a foot race  a boxing match  and a shooting contest  In all those contests  Aeneas is careful to reward winners and losers  showing his leadership qualities by not allowing for antagonism even after foul play  Afterward  Ascanius leads a military parade and demonstration  prefiguring Rome future predilection for war  During those events (in which only men participate)  Juno incites the womenfolk to burn the fleet and prevent them from ever reaching Italy  but her plan is thwarted when Ascanius and then Aeneas intervene  Aeneas prays to Jupiter to quench the fires  which the god does with a torrential rainstorm  An anxious Aeneas is comforted by a vision of his father  who tells him to go down to the underworld to receive a vision of his and Rome future  which he will do in Book 6  In return for safe passage to Italy  the gods  by order of Jupiter  will receive one of Aeneas men as sacrifice: Palinurus  who steers Aeneas ship by night  falls overboard and is drowned  In Book 6  Aeneas  with the guidance of the Cumaean Sibyl  descends into the underworld through an opening at Cumae; there he speaks with the spirit of his father and is offered a prophetic vision of the destiny of Rome  Upon returning to the land of the living  Aeneas leads the Trojans to settle in the land of Latium  where he courts Lavinia  the daughter of king Latinus  Although Aeneas would have wished to avoid it  war eventually breaks out  Juno is heavily involved in causing this war‚Äîshe convinces the Queen of Latium to demand that Lavinia be married to Turnus  the king of a local people  the Rutuli  Juno continues to stir up trouble  even summoning the Fury Alecto to ensure that a war takes place  Seeing the masses of Italians that Turnus has brought against him  Aeneas seeks help from the Tuscans  enemies of Turnus  He meets King Evander from Arcadia  whose son Pallas agrees to lead troops against the other Italians  Meanwhile  the Trojan camp is being attacked  and a midnight raid leads to the deaths of Nisus and his companion Euryalus  in one of the most emotional passages in the book  The gates  however  are defended until Aeneas returns with his Tuscan and Arcadian reinforcements  In the battling that follows  many heroes are killed‚Äînotably Pallas  who is killed by Turnus  and Mezentius  Turnus' close associate  The latter  who has inadvertently allowed his son to be killed while he himself fled  reproaches himself and faces Aeneas in single combat‚Äîan honourable but essentially futile pursuit  Another notable hero  Camilla  a sort of Amazon character  fights bravely but is eventually killed  She has been a virgin devoted to Diana and to her nation; the man who kills her is struck dead by Diana sentinel Opis after doing so  even though he tries to escape  After this  single combat is proposed between Aeneas and Turnus  but Aeneas is so obviously superior that the Italians  urged on by Turnus divine sister  Juturna  break the truce  Aeneas is injured  but returns to the battle shortly afterwards  Turnus and Aeneas dominate the battle on opposite wings  but when Aeneas makes a daring attack at the city of Latium (causing the queen of Latium to hang herself in despair)  he forces Turnus into single combat once more  In a dramatic scene  Turnus strength deserts him as he tries to hurl a rock  and he is struck by Aeneas spear in the leg  As Turnus is begging on his knees for his life  the poem ends with Aeneas killing him in rage when he sees that Turnus is wearing the belt of his friend Pallas as a trophy ,0,1,0,0,0

302,The Queen of the Damned,Part One follows several different people over the same period of several days  Several of the characters appear in the two previous books  including Armand  Daniel (the boy reporter of Interview with the Vampire)  Marius  Louis  Gabrielle and Santino  Each of the six chapters in Part One tells a different story about a different person or group of people  Two things unify these chapters: a series of dreams about red haired twin sisters  and the fact that a powerful being is killing vampires around the world by means of spontaneous combustion  Pandora and Santino rescue Marius  having answered his telepathic call for help  Marius informs his rescuers that Akasha has been awakened by Lestat  or rather his rock music  for he has joined a rock band of mortals whose names are Alex  Larry and Tough Cookie  Having been awakened by Lestat rebellious music  Akasha destroys her husband Enkil and plots to rule the world  Akasha is also revealed as the source of the attacks on other vampires  Part Two takes place at Lestat concert  Jesse  a member of the secret Talamasca and relative of Maharet  is mortally injured while attending the concert  and is taken to Maharet Sonoma compound where she is made into a vampire  The vampires from Part One later congregate in the Sonoma compound  The only vampires not present are Akasha and Lestat  Akasha has abducted Lestat and takes him as an unwilling consort to various locations in the world  inciting women to rise up and kill the men who have oppressed them  Part Three takes place at Maharet home in a Sonoma forest  There Maharet tells the story of Akasha and the red haired twins (who are  in fact  Maharet and her sister  Mekare) to Pandora  Jesse  Marius  Santino  Eric  Armand  Daniel  Louis and Gabrielle  Also present are Mael and Khayman  who already know the story  In Part Four  Akasha confronts the gathered vampires at Maharet compound  There she explains her plans and offers the vampires a chance to be her angels in her New World Order  Akasha plans to kill 90 percent of the world human men  and to establish a new Eden in which women will worship Akasha as a goddess  If the assembled vampires refuse to follow her  she will destroy them  The vampires refuse  but before Akasha can destroy them  Mekare enters  Mekare kills Akasha by severing her head  Mekare then consumes Akasha brain and heart  thereby saving the lives of the remaining vampires and becoming the new Queen of the Damned  In Part Five  the vampires leave Maharet compound and assemble at Armand resort  the Night Island  (according to Anne Rice  inspired by Fire Island) in Florida to recover  They eventually go their separate ways (as told in The Tale of the Body Thief)  Lestat takes Louis to see David Talbot in London  After their brief visit with Talbot they depart into the night  an incensed Louis and his angry words filling Lestat with glee  The Queen of the Damned  deals with the origins of vampires themselves  The mother of all vampires  Akasha  begins as a pre Egyptian queen  in a land called Kemet (which will become Egypt)  many thousands of years ago  During this time two powerful witches (Maharet and Mekare) live in the mountains of an unnamed region  The witches are able to communicate with invisible spirits and gain simple favors from them  During this period there is a bloodthirsty  invisible spirit known as Amel who continually asks the two witches if they need his assistance  although they prudently decline the offer  The witches' village is destroyed and they are incarcerated by the king and queen  who desire their knowledge  When the witches offend Akasha  the Queen condemns the twins  Enkil then orders his chief steward (who is Khayman as a mortal man) to rape the twins in his stead  which would prove their lack of power  before the eyes of the court  Afterward the witches are cast out into the desert  While making her way back home with a pregnant Maharet  Mekare curses the king and queen secretly with the bloodthirsty spirit  Eventually this spirit inflicts such torment on Akasha and Enkil that they again demand advice and help from the two witches  Conspirators  unhappy with the young king policies  assassinate the royal couple in Khayman house whilst they were attempting to exorcise Amel  who had been tormenting Khayman  While the king and queen lie dying  the evil spirit sees its chance to ensnare the soul of the dying queen and pulls it back into her body  The spirit combines itself with the flesh and blood of the queen  transforming her into a vampire  Akasha allows the king to drink her blood  which saves his life  They then order Khayman to find the witches and bring them back to Egypt so that they could use their knowledge of spirits to help them  as they feel guilty because of their thirst for blood  However  when the witches admit that they cannot help the monarchs  Akasha orders the mutilation of the witches: Maharet loses her eyes and Mekare her tongue  Afterward  Khayman  who had been turned into a vampire by Akasha  comes to the witches' cell and turns them too  The three flee together  but are caught by Akasha soldiers  Khayman escapes  but Maharet and Mekare are further punished  The witches are put into two separate coffins which are then set afloat on two separate bodies of water  They are only reunited near the end of the novel Queen of the Damned  In Mekare absence  Maharet returns to watch over her daughter and her descendants  Maharet descendants become what she calls the Great Family  A maternal line  the Great Family includes every culture  religion  ethnicity  and race  The Great Family represents all humanity and shows the vampires what Akasha would destroy with the creation of her New World Order  As the source of all vampires  Akasha is connected to all vampires by the blood and spirit they collectively share  In an experiment by the first Keeper  Akasha and Enkil are exposed to

303,Gulliver Travels,;4 May 1699 ‚Äî 13 April 1702 The book begins with a short preamble in which Lemuel Gulliver  in the style of books of the time  gives a brief outline of his life and history before his voyages  He enjoys travelling  although it is that love of travel that is his downfall  During his first voyage  Gulliver is washed ashore after a shipwreck and finds himself a prisoner of a race of tiny people  less than 6 inches tall  who are inhabitants of the island country of Lilliput  After giving assurances of his good behaviour  he is given a residence in Lilliput and becomes a favourite of the court  From there  the book follows Gulliver observations on the Court of Lilliput  He is also given the permission to roam around the city on a condition that he would not harm their subjects  Gulliver assists the Lilliputians to subdue their neighbours  the Blefuscudians  by stealing their fleet  However  he refuses to reduce the island nation of Blefuscu to a province of Lilliput  displeasing the King and the court  Gulliver is convicted of treason for making water in the capital (even though he was putting out a fire and saving countless lives)  among other crimes  Gulliver is charged with treason and sentenced to be blinded  With the assistance of a kind friend  Gulliver escapes to Blefuscu  where he spots and retrieves an abandoned boat and sails out to be rescued by a passing ship which safely takes him back home  This book of the Travels is a topical political satire  ;20 June 1702 ‚Äî 3 June 1706 When the sailing ship Adventure is blown off course by storms and forced to put in to land for want of fresh water  Gulliver is abandoned by his companions and found by a farmer who is tall (the scale of Brobdingnag is about 12:1  compared to Lilliput 1:12  judging from Gulliver estimating a man step being )  He brings Gulliver home and his daughter cares for Gulliver  The farmer treats him as a curiosity and exhibits him for money  The word gets out and the Queen of Brobdingnag wants to see the show  She loves Gulliver and she buys him and keeps him as a favourite at court  Since Gulliver is too small to use their huge chairs  beds  knives and forks  the queen commissions a small house to be built for Gulliver so that he can be carried around in it  This is referred to as his 'travelling box'  Between small adventures such as fighting giant wasps and being carried to the roof by a monkey  he discusses the state of Europe with the King  The King is not happy with Gulliver accounts of Europe  especially upon learning of the use of guns and cannons  On a trip to the seaside  his travelling box is seized by a giant eagle which drops Gulliver and his box into the sea  where he is picked up by some sailors  who return him to England  This book compares the truly moral man to the representative man; the latter is clearly shown to be the lesser of the two  Swift  being in Anglican holy orders  was likely to make such comparisons  ;5 August 1706 ‚Äî 16 April 1710 After Gulliver ship is attacked by pirates  he is marooned close to a desolate rocky island  near India  Fortunately he is rescued by the flying island of Laputa  a kingdom devoted to the arts of music and mathematics but unable to use them for practical ends  (La puta is Spanish for the whore  Swift was attacking reason and the deism movement in this book  the last one he wrote for the Travels ) Laputa custom of throwing rocks down at rebellious cities on the ground seems the first time that aerial bombardment was conceived as a method of warfare  Gulliver tours Laputa as the guest of a low ranking courtier and sees the ruin brought about by the blind pursuit of science without practical results  in a satire on bureaucracy and on the Royal Society and its experiments  At the Grand Academy of Lagado  great resources and manpower are employed on researching completely preposterous schemes such as extracting sunbeams from cucumbers  softening marble for use in pillows  learning how to mix paint by smell  and uncovering political conspiracies by examining the excrement of suspicious persons (see muckraking)  Gulliver is then taken to Balnibarbi to await a trader who can take him on to Japan  While waiting for passage  Gulliver takes a short side trip to the island of Glubbdubdrib  where he visits a magician dwelling and discusses history with the ghosts of historical figures  the most obvious restatement of the ancients versus moderns theme in the book  In Luggnagg he encounters the struldbrugs  unfortunates who are immortal  They do not have the gift of eternal youth  but suffer the infirmities of old age and are considered legally dead at the age of eighty  After reaching Japan  Gulliver asks the Emperor to excuse my performing the ceremony imposed upon my countrymen of trampling upon the crucifix  which the Emperor grants  Gulliver returns home  determined to stay there for the rest of his days  ;7 September 1710 ‚Äì 2 July 1715 Despite his earlier intention of remaining at home  Gulliver returns to the sea as the captain of a merchantman as he is bored with his employment as a surgeon  On this voyage he is forced to find new additions to his crew whom he believes to have turned the rest of the crew against him  His crew then mutiny  and after keeping him contained for some time resolve to leave him on the first piece of land they come across and continue as pirates  He is abandoned in a landing boat and comes upon a race of hideous  deformed and savage humanoid creatures to which he conceives a violent antipathy  Shortly afterwards he meets a race of horses who call themselves Houyhnhnms (which in their language means the perfection of nature); they are the rulers  while the deformed creatures called Yahoos are human beings in their base form  Gulliver becomes a member of a horse household  and comes to both admire and emulate the Houyhnhnms and their lifestyle  rejecting his fellow humans as merely Yahoos endowed with some semblance of reason which they only use to exacerbate and add to the vices Nature gave them  However  an Assembly of the Houyhnhnms rules that Gulliver  a Yahoo with some semblance of reason  is a danger to their civilization  and expels him  He is then rescued  against his will  by a Portuguese ship  and is surprised to see that Captain Pedro de Mendez  a Yahoo  is a wise  courteous and generous person  He returns to his home in England  but he is unable to reconcile himself to living among Yahoos and becomes a recluse  remaining in his house  largely avoiding his family and his wife  and spending several hours a day speaking with the horses in his stables  This book uses coarse metaphors to describe human depravity  and the Houyhnhms are symbolized as not only perfected nature but also the emotional barrenness which Swift maintained that devotion to reason brought ,1,0,0,0,0
304,A Midsummer Night Dream, The play features three interlocking plots  connected by a celebration of the wedding of Duke Theseus of Athens and the Amazon queen  Hippolyta  which is set simultaneously in the woodland and in the realm of Fairyland  under the light of the moon  In the opening scene  Hermia refuses to follow her father  Egeus  instructions to marry Demetrius  whom he has chosen for her  In response  Egeus quotes before Theseus an ancient Athenian law whereby a daughter must marry the suitor chosen by her father  or else face death  Theseus offers her another choice: lifelong chastity while worshiping the goddess Diana as a nun  At that same time  Peter Quince and his fellow players gather to produce a stage play  the most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisbe  for the Duke and the Duchess  Quince reads the names of characters and bestows them to the players  Nick Bottom  who is playing the main role of Pyramus  is over enthusiastic and wants to dominate others by suggesting himself for the characters of Thisbe  the Lion  and Pyramus at the same time  He would also rather be a tyrant and recites some lines of Ercles  Quince ends the meeting with at the Duke oak we meet  Meanwhile  Oberon  king of the fairies  and his queen  Titania  have come to the forest outside Athens  Titania tells Oberon that she plans to stay there until she has attended Theseus and Hippolyta wedding  Oberon and Titania are estranged because Titania refuses to give her Indian changeling to Oberon for use as his knight or henchman  since the child mother was one of Titania worshippers  Oberon seeks to punish Titania disobedience  so he calls for his mischievous court jester Puck or Robin Goodfellow to help him apply a magical juice from a flower called love in idleness  originally it was a white flower but when struck by Cupid bow it tints the flower purple  When someone applies the potion to a sleeping person eyelids  it makes the victim fall in love with the first living thing seen upon awakening  He instructs Puck to retrieve the flower so that he can make Titania fall in love with the first thing she sees when waking up  which he is sure will be an animal of the forest  Oberon intent is to shame Titania into giving up the little Indian boy  He says  And ere I take this charm from off her sight  / As I can take it with another herb  / I'll make her render up her page to me  Having seen Demetrius act cruelly toward Helena  Oberon orders Puck to spread some of the magical juice from the flower on the eyelids of the young Athenian man  Instead  Puck mistakes Lysander for Demetrius  not having actually seen either before  and administers the juice to the sleeping Lysander  Helena  coming across him  wakes him while attempting to determine whether he is dead or asleep  Upon this happening  Lysander immediately falls in love with Helena  Oberon sees Demetrius still following Hermia and is enraged  When Demetrius decides to go to sleep  Oberon sends Puck to get Helena while he charms Demetrius' eyes  Upon waking up  he sees Helena  Now  both men are in pursuit of Helena  However  she is convinced that her two suitors are mocking her  as neither loved her originally  Hermia is at a loss to see why her lover has abandoned her  and accuses Helena of stealing Lysander away from her  The four quarrel with each other until Lysander and Demetrius become so enraged that they seek a place to duel each other to prove whose love for Helena is the greatest  Oberon orders Puck to keep Lysander and Demetrius from catching up with one another and to remove the charm from the two men  so that they are back to normal  Lysander continues to love Hermia  and Demitrius realizes that he does love Helena  Meanwhile  Quince and his band of six labourers (rude mechanicals  as they are described by Puck) have arranged to perform their play about Pyramus and Thisbe for Theseus' wedding and venture into the forest  near Titania bower  for their rehearsal  Bottom is spotted by Puck  who (taking his name to be another word for a jackass) transforms his head into that of a donkey  When Bottom returns for his next lines  the other workmen run screaming in terror  much to Bottom confusion  since he hasn't felt a thing during the transformation  Determined to wait for his friends  he begins to sing to himself  Titania is awakened by Bottom singing and immediately falls in love with him  She lavishes him with attention and presumably makes love to him  While she is in this state of devotion  Oberon takes the changeling  Having achieved his goals  Oberon releases Titania  orders Puck to remove the donkey head from Bottom  and arrange everything so that Hermia  Lysander  Demetrius  and Helena will believe that they have been dreaming when they awaken  The fairies then disappear  and Theseus and Hippolyta arrive on the scene  during an early morning hunt  They wake the lovers and  since Demetrius does not love Hermia any more  Theseus overrules Egeus demands and arranges a group wedding  The lovers decide that the night events must have been a dream  After they all exit  Bottom awakes  and he too decides that he must have experienced a dream past the wit of man  In Athens  Theseus  Hippolyta and the lovers watch the six workmen perform Pyramus and Thisbe  Given a lack of preparation  the performers are so terrible playing their roles to the point where the guests laugh as if it were meant to be a comedy  and afterward everyone retires to bed  Afterward  Oberon  Titania  Puck  and other fairies enter  and bless the house and its occupants with good fortune  After all other characters leave  Puck restores amends and suggests to the audience that what they just experienced might be nothing but a dream (hence the name of the play) ,0,1,0,0,0
305,The Forge of God, The novel features scenes and events including the discovery of a near dead alien in the desert  who clearly says in English  I am sorry  but there is bad news  and this alien subsequent interrogation and autopsy; the discovery of an artificial geological formation and its subsequent nuclear destruction by a desperate military; and the Earth eventual destruction by the mutual annihilation of a piece of neutronium and a piece of antineutronium dropped into Earth core  There is another alien faction at work  however  represented on Earth by small spider like robots that recruit human agents through some form of mind control  They frantically collect all the human data  biological records  tissue samples  seeds  and DNA from the biosphere that they can  and evacuate a handful of people from Earth  In space  this faction machines combat and eventually destroy the attackers  though not before Earth fate is sealed  The evacuees eventually settle a newly terraformed Mars while some form the crew of a Ship of the Law to hunt down the home world of the killers  a quest described in the sequel  Anvil of Stars  One of the point of view characters is Arthur Gordon  a scientist who  with his wife Francine and son Martin is among those rescued from the destruction of Earth  Some other characters are close to an American president who fails to take action against the threat  The two books show at least one solution to the Fermi paradox  with electromagnetically noisy civilisations being snuffed out by the arrival of self replicating machines designed to destroy any potential threat to their (possibly long dead) creators  (A similar theme is explored in Fred Saberhagen Berserker novels ),1,0,0,0,0

309,The Puppet Masters,Sam is an agent in Section  a United States government intelligence organization  It is so secret it reports only to the President  and is entirely unknown to anyone else  Sam is superbly trained  equipped with a built in communicator he calls a skull phone as well as a number of ways to commit suicide if the need arises  Called in by the Old Man  his boss and the head of the organization  they go to investigate the report of a flying saucer landing in Grinnell  Iowa after other agents sent earlier fail to report back  With them is another agent named Mary  a stunningly beautiful redhead  Sam is informed that her life is only slightly less precious than the Old Man  and that he (Sam) is the most expendable  In Iowa  they discover that the people are being brought under the mental control of repulsive  slug like creatures that attach to their backs  just below the neck  Detaching one slug from its host  they seal it in a film canister and bring it back to headquarters in Washington  D C  By the time they get there though  the remains of the slug are a stinking mess  and they are unable to convince the President that there is an invasion  Sam eventually leads a small team back to Iowa  They inadvertently succeed in capturing a live slug  as one agent becomes hagridden without them realizing it  However  Mary spots it when he does not react to her allure like a normal male  The agent is unmasked  subdued and confined  The slug escapes by transferring to another person  and eventually to Sam himself  He immediately becomes enslaved and escapes the agency  Meanwhile  the invasion continues to expand  Slugs are shipped through the mail to recruit more humans  Gradually they infect more and more important people  especially the members of exclusive clubs frequented by politicians  Before the Old Man tracks Sam down and captures him  they have infected the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury  whose department controls the United States Secret Service (responsible for the President personal security); the slugs are a step away from infecting the President himself  By the time Sam recovers in hospital  anyone fully dressed is suspect  The Old Man wants someone to wear the slug so it can be interrogated  Sam cannot bear the idea  but when Mary volunteers  he gives in and does it himself  He is completely aware of himself when possessed  but totally committed to the slugs' cause  The slug dies under torture from electric shocks  but in the process Sam learns that they come from Titan  the largest moon of Saturn  Thoroughly disgusted by the treatment he has received  Sam is ready to quit  He is at first furious with Mary for entrapping him  and then with the Old Man  when he learns that his boss tricked Mary into it  At this point  it is revealed that the Old Man is Sam father  Eventually the politicians realize the danger  From Minnesota to Louisiana  the center of the country has been taken over  On a solo mission to Kansas City  Sam is shocked to discover that the number of slugs is much greater than thought  Instead of taking over key people  they have absorbed the entire human population of the occupied territory  However  he and the Old Man are unable to convince the President to stop a meticulously planned military counter invasion of the heartland; the entire force is taken over by the enemy  They find that slugs are capable of fissioning in two fairly quickly  The number of infected humans must now be so large that any military action would kill tens of millions  The problem having reached a scale beyond their ability to influence it  Sam and Mary are given leave  By this time  they have fallen in love and get married before going to Sam bolt hole in the Adirondack Mountains  Their idyll is interrupted when a slug takes over first his beloved pet cat  then Mary  Sam manages to push Mary onto a hot fire to kill the slug  leaving them both badly burned  but alive and free  Returning to HQ for treatment  they find that a new law requires everyone to be functionally naked to show that a slug is not in control  The law is rigorously enforced not as much by police as by vigilantes  who often shoot first and confirm afterward  Sam begins to believe that the slugs have him marked for repossession  They can communicate by direct conference  where their hosts sit back to back and the slugs partially merge  A network of such interactions could spread his description rapidly among the invaders  who knew how valuable he is  Some scientists even speculate that the slugs are really just one organism in many bodies  For their part  the slugs drop all pretenses and openly wage war on the states to their east and west  Where human hosts cannot go  they use animals such as dogs  horses and even elephants  Sam and Mary go with the Old Man to investigate a saucer which crash landed in Mississippi  Inside they encounter the slugs' hosts from Titan  small elf like creatures  who died when Earth air entered the ship  There are also tanks containing humans in suspended animation  Mary has a mental breakdown when she enters the ship  It triggers long suppressed memories from when she was a child in a failed Venus colony which was taken over by slugs  She herself spent years in one of the tanks  Mary caught a disease which killed her slug  They discover that the disease is Nine day Fever  which is almost 100% fatal if untreated  However  they find that it kills slugs faster than humans  It might just be possible to spread the fever among the slugs using direct conference  and then treat as many humans as possible before they die  The Old Man springs a surprise on Sam  He had expected Sam to replace him one day  and Sam would show when he was ready by opposing the Old Man authority  From now on  Sam is in charge  official titles notwithstanding  Time is short ‚Äì diseases erupt in the infected areas  as the slugs neglect hygiene and often drive their hosts until they starve  Outbreaks of plague in the Communist countries suggest that they were taken over even before the center of the United States  The counter attack begins  Releasing animals with infected slugs into enemy territory  they wait for the epidemic to break out  Days pass  and then calls start coming in from desperate people whose slugs have died  Hundreds of thousands of agents  Sam and the Old Man among them  parachute in to treat victims with drug dispensing guns  Just when the battle seems won  the Old Man is possessed by one of the few healthy slugs and kidnaps Sam  intending to take them both into hiding to regroup for a new invasion  Sam watches in horror as the Old Man slug begins dividing so he too can be possessed  Despite being tied up  Sam is able to crash their flyer into the sea  killing the slug  In the final section  Sam writes in a journal before embarking with Mary on a spaceship which will take the battle to Titan  The slugs will remain a problem for years to come  having infected too many parts of the Earth to root out easily  but they will never be able to take over ,1,0,0,0,0
310,I Am Legend, The main character is Robert Neville  apparently the sole survivor of a pandemic whose symptoms resemble vampirism  It is implied that the pandemic was caused by a war  and that it was spread by dust storms in the cities and an explosion in the mosquito population  The narrative details Neville daily life in Los Angeles as he attempts to comprehend  research  and possibly cure the disease  to which he is immune  Neville past is revealed through flashbacks  The vampires only come out at night and become comatose by day  though they also sometimes come out earlier during cloudy weather  Neville survives by barricading himself by sunset inside his house  further protected by garlic  mirrors  and crosses  Swarms of vampires would regularly surround his house  trying to find ways to get inside  During the day  he scavenges for supplies and methodically searches out the inactive vampires  driving stakes into their hearts to kill them  After bouts of depression and alcoholism  Neville decides to find out the scientific cause of the pandemic  He obtains books and other research materials from a library  and through painstaking research discovers the root of the vampiric disease in a strain of bacteria capable of infecting both deceased and living hosts  He also discovers that much of the efficacy of the garlic  mirrors  and crosses were actually hysterical blindess  the result of previous psychological conditioning of the infected (particularly the religious) who believed that they were effective against vampires  Driven to insanity by the disease  the vampires now reacted as they believed they should react when confronted with these items  Even then  it was constrained to the beliefs of the particular person  such that a vampire who was Christian would fear the cross  but a vampire who was Jewish would not  Neville also discovers more efficient means of killing the infected  other than just driving a stake into their hearts  This included exposing them to direct sunlight (which killed the bacteria) or inflicting deep wounds on their bodies so that the bacteria switch from being anaerobic symbionts to aerobic parasites  rapidly consuming their hosts when exposed to air  He is now killing such large numbers of vampires in his daily forays that his nightly visitors have diminished significantly  After three years  Neville sees an apparently uninfected woman  Ruth  abroad in the daylight  and captures her  After some convincing  Ruth tells him her story of how she and her husband survived the pandemic (though her husband was killed two weeks earlier)  Neville is puzzled by the fact that she is upset when he speaks of killing vampires  on grounds that if her story of survival was true  she would have become hardened to the act  One night Neville is startled awake and finds Ruth about to leave  Suspicious  he questions her motives  but relates the trauma of his past  whereupon they comfort each other  Ruth reluctantly allows him a blood sample but knocks him senseless when he realizes she is infected  When he wakes  Neville discovers a note from Ruth confessing that she is actually infected and that Neville was responsible for her husband death  Ruth admits that she was sent to spy on him  The infected have slowly overcome their disease until they can spend short periods of time in sunlight and are attempting to rebuild society; but they fear and hate Neville who has destroyed some of their people along with the true vampires (dead bodies animated by the germ) during his daytime excursions against the latter  Ruth warns Neville that her people will attempt to capture him  and that he should leave his house and escape; but Neville disregards Ruth warning and is captured  Neville wakes in a prison where he is visited by Ruth  who informs him that she is a ranking member of the new society but  unlike the others  does not resent him  She acknowledges the need for Neville execution  and gives him pills  claiming they will make it easier  Badly injured  Neville accepts his fate and asks Ruth not to let this society become heartless  Ruth kisses him and leaves  Neville goes to his prison window and sees all the infected waiting for his execution  Judging by their reactions to the sight of him  he now recognizes their point of view  Having hitherto seen the destruction of the infected survivors as a moral imperative to be pursued for his own and mankind survival  he failed to realize that the infected have come to view him in fear and awe  To them  he was an invisible killer who moved by day  killing their loved ones as they hibernated  He realizes that even as vampires were legend in pre infection times  he  a remnant of old humanity  is now a legend to the new race born of the infection  He therefore remarks to himself as he dies: [I am] a new superstition entering the unassailable fortress of forever  I am legend ,1,0,0,0,0
311,The Man in the High Castle,Giuseppe Zangara assassination of United States  President elect Franklin D  Roosevelt  in 1933  led to the weak governments of John Nance Garner (formerly FDR VP elect)  and later of the Republican John W  Bricker in 1940  Both politicians failed to surmount the Great Depression and maintained the country isolationist policy against participating in the Second World War; thus  the United States  had insufficient military capabilities to assist the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union against Nazi Germany  or to defend itself against Japan in the Pacific  In 1941  the Nazis conquered the USSR and then exterminated most of its Slavic peoples; the few whom they allowed to live were confined to reservations  In the Pacific  the Japanese destroyed the entire United States  Navy fleet in a decisive  definitive attack on Pearl Harbor; thereafter  the superior Japanese military conquered Hawaii  Australia  New Zealand and Oceania during the early forties  Afterward  the Axis Powers  each attacking from opposite fronts  conquered the coastal United States  and  by 1947  the United States and other remaining Allied forces surrendered to the Axis  Japan established the puppet Pacific States of America out of Alaska  California  Hawaii  Oregon  parts of Nevada and Washington as part of the Greater East Asian Co Prosperity Sphere  The remaining Mountain  Great Plains and Southwestern states became the Rocky Mountain States  a buffer between the PSA and the remaining USA  now a Nazi puppet state in the style of Vichy France  Having defeated the Allies of World War II  the Third Reich and Imperial Japan became the resultant superpowers of their world and consequently embarked upon a Cold War  One of the core narrative elements (Operation Dandelion) is centred on a pre emptive Nazi nuclear strike on the Japanese Home Islands  The Nazis have the hydrogen bomb and the ability to wipe out the Home Islands  Their nuclear energy capabilities also fuel extremely fast air travel and the colonization of the moon  Venus  and Mars  After Adolf Hitler syphilitic incapacitation  Martin Bormann  as Nazi Party Chancellor  assumes power as F√ºhrer of Germany  Bormann proceeds to create a colonial empire to increase Germany Lebensraum by using technology to drain the Mediterranean Sea and convert it into farmland (see Atlantropa)  while sending spaceships to colonize Mars and other parts of the Solar System in the name of the Reich  As the novel begins  F√ºhrer Bormann dies  initiating an internal power struggle between Joseph Goebbels  Reinhard Heydrich  Hermann G√∂ring  and other top Nazis to succeed him as Reichskanzler  The Man in the High Castle contains a loose collection of characters  Some of them know each other  while others are connected in more indirect ways as they all cope with living under totalitarianism  Three characters guide their lives based on the I Ching: *Nobusuke Tagomi is a trade missioner in Japanese San Francisco  To start with  the reader is let in to his world only slightly; this character does not intend to be a big part of the story but events unfold in a way that drags him into both central and peripheral conflicts with agendas beyond his control  *Frank Frink works for the Wyndham‚ÄìMatson Corporation  which specializes in reproductions of pre war Americana artifacts; he is fired for showing his temper  He is a secret Jew (n√© Fink) who hides to avoid extermination in a Nazi camp  He is a veteran of the Pacific War  *Juliana Frink  a judo instructor  is Frank ex wife  After an initially short introduction her character evolves throughout the rest of the book to her becoming a very central plot piece  She is also used throughout the book by a hired assassin  Others believe different things: *Robert Childan owns American Artistic Handcrafts  an Americana antiques business supplied by Wyndham‚ÄìMatson Inc  He believes the items genuine; Tagomi is one of his best customers  who buys gifts for himself and for visiting businessmen  Given his mostly Japanese clientele  Childan has adopted their manners  Anglicised modes of speech  and ways of thinking  yet  despite his surface deference to the Japanese  he is contemptuous of them  privately retaining his pre war white supremacy ‚Äî believing in the essential inferiority of the non white Asian and African races  Nonetheless  he is very conscious of his image  often deliberating  to himself  in the Asian mentality  how his actions might appear to others  *Wyndham Matson (Frank Frink boss) muses about the difference between a real antique and a reproduction antique; via his mistress  he introduces the novel The Grasshopper Lies Heavy to the plot and is the plot device used to show the initial difference of opinions in the novel  the differing opinions being those that believe The Grasshopper Lies Heavy is merely a work of good fiction  and those that believe it shows something more (a theme that reaches its climax at the end of the novel)  *Mr  Baynes  a wealthy Swedish industrialist  is actually Rudolf Wegener  a Captain in Reich Naval Counter Intelligence  who is en route to meet Tagomi  through whom he expects to meet an important Japanese representative  He is taken aback by Tagomi gift of a genuine Mickey Mouse watch (bought at the American Artistic Handicrafts Inc  shop)  The narrative storylines of the plot alternate among those of the characters  providing a broad picture of quotidian life in totalitarian America: *Baynes travels undercover to San Francisco  as a Swedish merchant  There  he talks with Tagomi  but  in pursuit of his true mission  must prolong their meeting until the arrival  from Japan  of Mr  Yatabe (General Tedeki  formerly of the Imperial General Staff)  His mission is to warn the Japanese of Operation L√∂wenzahn (Operation Dandelion)  a nuclear attack upon the Japanese Archipelago Home Islands planned by Joseph Goebbels faction within the ruling Nazi Party and opposed by Heydrich faction  *Frank Frink and his friend Ed McCarthy start a jewelry business;

316,Podkayne of Mars,The book is a first person narrative in the form of Podkayne diaries  Podkayne is 15 in Earth years (a bit over eight Martian years) while her genius younger brother Clark is 11 earth years (6 martian years)  Due to the unscheduled uncorking (birth) of their three test tube babies  Podkayne parents cancel a much anticipated trip to Earth  Disappointed  Podkayne confesses her misery to her uncle  Senator Tom Fries  an elder statesman of the Mars government  Tom arranges for Clark and Podkayne  escorted by himself  to get upgraded passage on a luxury liner to Earth  During boarding  Clark is asked by a customs official Anything to declare  and facetiously answers Two kilos of happy dust! As he anticipated  his seemingly flippant remark gets him taken away and searched  just in time to divert attention away from Podkayne luggage  where he has hidden a package he was paid to smuggle aboard  Podkayne suspects the reason behind her brother behavior  but cannot prove it  Clark was told it was a present for the captain  but is far too cynical to be taken in  He later carefully opens the package and finds a nuclear bomb  which he  in typical Clark fashion  disarms and keeps  Much of the description of the voyage is based on Heinlein own experiences as a naval officer and world traveler  Clark ploy is taken from a real life incident related in Heinlein Tramp Royale in which his wife answers the same question with heroin substituted for the fictitious but equally illegal happy dust  Once aboard  they are befriended by Girdie  an attractive  capable  experienced woman left impoverished by her late husband  Much to Podkayne surprise  the normally very self centered Clark contracts a severe case of puppy love  The liner makes a stop at Venus  which is depicted as a latter day Las Vegas gone ultra capitalistic  The planet is controlled by a single corporation; the dream of most of the frantically enterprising residents is to earn enough to buy a single share in it  which guarantees lifelong financial security  Just about anything goes  as long as one can pay for it  The penalty for murder is a fine paid to the corporation for the victim estimated value plus his projected future earnings  On a less serious level  Heinlein anticipated  by over forty years  television ads in taxicabs (in the book  holographic)  which have since been implemented in taxicabs in major cities worldwide  The Fries are given VIP treatment by the Venus Corporation and Podkayne is escorted by Dexter Cunha  the Chairman dashing son  She begins to realize that Tom is much more than just her pinochle playing uncle  When Clark vanishes and even the corporation is unable to find him  Tom reveals that he is on a secret diplomatic mission  and the children have been his protective coloration‚Äîinstead of an accredited representative to a vital conference on Luna  Tom appears to be a doddering uncle escorting two young people on a tour of the solar system  Clark has been kidnapped by functionaries of a political faction opposed to Tom  Podkayne makes an ill judged attempt to rescue Clark by herself and falls into the kidnappers' clutches as well  only to find her uncle caught too  The captors' scheme is to use the children to blackmail the uncle into doing their bidding at the Luna conference  Clark quickly realizes that once Uncle Tom is released  no matter what happens  their kidnappers will have little reason to keep their prisoners alive  He is prepared  however  and engineers an escape  leaving a bomb behind to blow up the kidnappers  In Heinlein original ending  Podkayne is killed  This did not please his publisher  who demanded and got a rewrite over the author bitter objections  In a letter to Lurton Blassingame  his literary agent  Heinlein complained that it would be like revising Romeo and Juliet to let the young lovers live happily ever after  He also declared that changing the end isn't real life  because in real life  not everything ends happily  In the original ending  after they escape from the kidnappers to a safe distance  Podkayne remembers that a semi intelligent Venerian fairy baby has been left behind  and returns to rescue it  When the nuclear bomb that Clark leaves for the kidnappers blows up  Podkayne is killed  shielding the young fairy with her body  Clark takes over the narrative for the last chapter  The story ends with a hint of hope for him  as he admits his responsibility for what happened to Podkayne &mdash; that he fubbed it  mighty dry &mdash; then shows some human feeling by regretting his inability to cry and describes his plan to raise the fairy himself  In the revised version  Podkayne is injured by the bomb  but not fatally  Uncle Tom  in a phone conversation with Podkayne father  blames the parents ‚Äî especially the mother ‚Äî for neglecting the upbringing of the children  Uncle Tom feels that Clark is dangerous and maladjusted  and attributes this to the mother giving priority to her career  Clark still takes over as the narrator  and  again  regrets that Podkayne was hurt and plans to take care of the fairy  this time because Podkayne will want to see it when she is better  The 1995 Baen edition includes both endings (which differ only on the last page)  Jim Baen own edited postlude to the story  and a collection of readers' essays giving their opinions about which ending is better  Most of these readers favored the sad ending  partly because they felt Heinlein should have been free to create his own story  and partly because they believed that the changed ending turned a tragedy into a mere adventure  and not a very well constructed one at that  Podkayne appears in Heinlein later novel The Number of the Beast  attending the party at the end along with many other Heinlein characters from previous books ,1,0,0,0,0

318,The Andromeda Strain,When a military satellite returns to Earth  a recovery team is dispatched to retrieve it; during a live radio communication with their base  the team members suddenly die  Aerial surveillance reveals that everyone in Piedmont  Arizona  the town closest to where the satellite landed  is apparently dead  The base commander suspects the satellite returned with an extraterrestrial organism and recommends activating Wildfire  the government sponsored team that counters extraterrestrial biological infestation  The Wildfire scientific team studying the unknown strain is composed of Dr  Jeremy Stone  bacteriologist specialist; Dr  Peter Leavitt  disease pathology; Dr  Charles Burton  infection vectors specialist; and Dr  Mark Hall  M D   surgeon  biochemistry and pH specialist  Hall is the odd man  since he is the only one without a spouse  The Robertson Odd Man Hypothesis states that unmarried men are capable of carrying out the best  most dispassionate decisions during crises and he is given the only key that can disarm the self destruct mechanism  A fifth scientist  Dr  Christian Kirke  anthropologist and electrolytes specialist  was unavailable for duty because of appendicitis  The scientists believe the satellite  which was actually designed to capture upper atmosphere microorganisms for bio weapon exploitation  returned with a deadly microorganism that kills by nearly instantaneous disseminated intravascular coagulation (lethal blood clotting)  Upon investigating the town  the Wildfire team discovers that the residents either died in mid stride or went quietly nuts and committed bizarre suicides  Two Piedmont inhabitants  the sick  Sterno addicted  geriatric Peter Jackson; and the constantly bawling infant  Jamie Ritter  are biologic opposites who somehow survived the organism  The man  infant  and satellite are taken to the secret underground Wildfire laboratory  a secure facility equipped with every known capacity for protection against a biological element escaping into the atmosphere  including a nuclear weapon to incinerate the facility if necessary  Wildfire is hidden in a remote area near the fictional town of Flatrock  Nevada  sixty miles from Las Vegas using a sort of purloined letter approach  by locating it in the sub basements of a legitimate Department of Agriculture research station  Further investigation determines that the bizarre deaths were caused by a crystal structured  extraterrestrial microbe on a meteor that crashed into the satellite  knocking it from orbit  The microbe contains chemical elements required for terrestrial life and appears to have a crystalline structure  but lacks DNA  RNA  proteins  and amino acids  yet it directly transforms matter to energy and vice versa  The microbe  code named Andromeda  mutates with each growth cycle  changing its biologic properties  The scientists learn that Andromeda grows only within a narrow pH range; in a too acid or too basic growth medium  it will not multiply&nbsp;&mdash; Andromeda pH range is 7 39‚Äì7 43  like that of human blood  That is why Jackson and Ritter survived: both had abnormal blood pH  However  by the time the scientists realize that  Andromeda current mutation degrades the plastic shield and escapes its containment  Trapped in an Andromeda contaminated laboratory  Dr  Burton demands that Stone inject him with Kalocin (the universal antibiotic); Stone refuses  arguing it would render Burton too vulnerable to infection by other harmful bacteria  Burton survives because Andromeda has already mutated to nonlethal form  The mutated Andromeda attacks the neoprene door and hatch seals within the Wildfire complex  racing to the upper levels and the surface  The self destruct atomic bomb is automatically armed when it detects a containment breach  triggering its detonation countdown to incinerate all exo biological diseases  As the bomb arms  the scientists realize that given Andromeda ability to generate matter directly from energy  the organism would feed  reproduce  and ultimately benefit from an atomic explosion  To halt the atomic detonation  Dr  Hall must insert his special key to an emergency substation anywhere in Wildfire  Unfortunately  he is trapped in a section with no substation  He must navigate Wildfire obstacle course of automatic defenses to reach a working substation on an upper level  He barely disarms the bomb in time before all the air is evacuated from the deepest level of the Wildfire complex  Andromeda eventually mutates to a benign form and is suspected to have migrated to the upper atmosphere  where the oxygen content is lower  better suiting Andromeda growth  The novel epilogue reveals that a manned spacecraft  Andros V  was incinerated during atmospheric re entry  presumably because Andromeda Strain ate the plastic heat shield of Andros V and caused it to burn up ,1,0,0,0,0

trying to kill the infant Harry  While the wizarding world celebrates Voldemort downfall  Professor Dumbledore  Professor McGonagall and Rubeus Hagrid place the one&nbsp;year old orphan in the care of his Muggle (non wizard) uncle and aunt: Vernon and Petunia Dursley  For ten years  they and their son Dudley neglect  torment and abuse Harry  Shortly before Harry eleventh birthday  a series of letters addressed to Harry arrive  but Vernon destroys them before Harry can read them  To get away from the letters  Vernon takes the family to a small island  As they are settling in  Hagrid bursts through the door to tell Harry what the Dursleys have kept him from finding out: Harry is a wizard and has been accepted at Hogwarts  Hagrid takes Harry to Diagon Alley  a magically concealed shopping precinct in London  where Harry is bewildered to discover how famous he is among wizards as the boy who lived  He also finds that he is quite wealthy  since a bequest from his parents has remained on deposit at Gringotts Wizarding Bank  Guided by Hagrid  he buys the books and equipment he needs for Hogwarts  as well as Hedwig the owl  At the wand shop  he finds that the wand that suits him best is the twin of Voldemort; both wands contain feathers from the same phoenix  A month later Harry leaves the Dursleys' home to catch the Hogwarts Express from King Cross railway station  There he meets the Weasley family  who show him how to pass through the magical wall to Platform 9¬æ  where the train is waiting  While on the train Harry makes friends with Ron Weasley  who tells him that someone tried to rob a vault at Gringotts  During the ride they meet Hermione Granger  Another new pupil  Draco Malfoy  accompanied by his sidekicks Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle  offers to advise Harry  but Harry dislikes Draco arrogance and prejudice  Before the term first dinner in the school Great Hall  the new pupils are allocated to houses by the magical Sorting Hat  Before it is Harry turn  he catches Professor Snape eye and feels a pain in the scar Voldemort left on his forehead  When it is Harry turn to be sorted  the Hat wonders whether he should be in Slytherin  but when Harry objects  the Hat sends him to join the Weasleys in Gryffindor  While Harry is eating  he questions Percy Weasley about Snape  After a terrible first Potions lesson with Snape  Harry and Ron visit Hagrid  who lives in a rustic house on the edge of the Forbidden Forest  There they learn that the attempted robbery at Gringotts happened the day Harry withdrew money  Harry remembers that Hagrid had removed a small package from the vault that was broken into and searched  During the new pupils' first broom flying lesson  Neville Longbottom breaks his wrist  and Draco takes advantage to throw the forgetful Neville fragile Remembrall high in the air  Harry gives chase on his broomstick  catching the Remembrall inches from the ground  Professor McGonagall dashes out and appoints him as the new Seeker for the Gryffindor Quidditch team  When Draco tricks Ron and Harry  accompanied by Neville and Hermione Granger  into a midnight excursion  they accidentally enter a forbidden corridor and find a huge three headed dog  The group hastily retreats  and Hermione notices that the dog is standing over a trap door  Harry concludes that the monster is guarding the package Hagrid retrieved from Gringotts  After Ron criticises Hermione ostentatious proficiency in Charms  she hides in tears in the girls' toilet  At the Halloween Night dinner Professor Quirrell hastily reports that a troll has entered the dungeons  While everyone else returns to their dormitories  Harry and Ron rush to warn Hermione  The troll corners Hermione in the toilet but when Harry sticks his wand up one of its nostrils  Ron uses the levitation spell to knock out the troll with its own club  Afterwards  several professors arrive and Hermione takes the blame for the battle and becomes a firm friend of the two boys  The evening before Harry first Quidditch match  he sees Snape receiving medical attention from Filch for a bite on his leg by the three headed dog  During the game  Harry broomstick goes out of control  endangering his life  and Hermione notices that Snape is staring at Harry and muttering  She dashes over to the Professors' stand  knocking over Professor Quirrell in her haste  and sets fire to Snape robe  Harry regains control of his broomstick and catches the Golden Snitch  winning the game for Gryffindor  Hagrid refuses to believe that Snape was responsible for Harry danger  but lets slip that he bought the three headed dog  and that the monster is guarding a secret that belongs to Professor Dumbledore and someone called Nicolas Flamel  Harry and the Weasleys stay at Hogwarts for Christmas  and one of Harry presents  from an anonymous donor  is an Invisibility Cloak owned by his father  Harry uses the Cloak to search the library Restricted Section for information about the mysterious Flamel  has to evade Snape and Filch after an enchanted book shrieks an alarm  and slips into a room containing the Mirror of Erised  which shows his parents and several of their ancestors  Harry becomes addicted to the Mirror visions and is rescued by Professor Dumbledore  who explains that it shows what the viewer most desperately longs for  When the rest of the pupils return for the next term  Draco plays a prank on Neville  and Harry consoles Neville with a sweet  The collectible card wrapped with the sweet identifies Flamel as an alchemist  Hermione soon finds that he is a 665 year old man who possesses the only known Philosopher Stone  from which can be extracted an elixir of life  A few days later Harry notices Snape sneaking towards the outskirts of the Forbidden Forest  There he half hears a furtive conversation about the Philosopher Stone  in which Snape asks Professor Quirrell if he has found a way past the three headed dog and menacingly tells Quirrell to decide whose side he is on  Harry concludes that Snape is trying to steal the Stone and Quirrell has helped prepare a series of defences for it  which was an almost fatal mistake  The three friends discover that Hagrid is raising a baby dragon  which is against wizard law  and arrange to smuggle it out of the country around midnight  Draco arrives  hoping to raise the alarm and get them into trouble  and goes to tell Professor McGonagall  Although Ron is bitten by the dragon and is sent to the infirmary  Harry and Hermione spirit the dragon safely away  However  they are caught  and Harry loses the Invisibility Cloak  As part of their punishment  Harry  Hermione  Draco  and Neville (who  trying to stop Harry and Hermione after hearing what Draco had been saying  had been caught by McGonagall as well) are compelled to help Hagrid to rescue a badly injured unicorn in the Forbidden Forest  They split into two parties  and Harry and Draco find the unicorn dead  surrounded by its blood  A hooded figure crawls to the corpse and drinks the blood  while Draco screams and flees  The hooded figure moves towards Harry  who is knocked out by an agonising pain spreading from his scar  When Harry regains consciousness  the hooded figure has gone and a centaur  Firenze  offers to give him a ride back to the school  The centaur tells Harry that drinking a unicorn blood will save the life of a mortally injured person  but at the price of having a cursed life from that moment on  Firenze suggests Voldemort drank the unicorn blood to gain enough strength to make the elixir of life from the Philosopher Stone  and regain full health by drinking that  On his return  Harry finds that someone has slipped the Invisibility Cloak under his sheets  A few weeks later  while relaxing after the end of session examinations  Harry suddenly wonders how something as illegal as a dragon egg came into Hagrid possession  The gamekeeper says he was given it by a hooded stranger who bought him several drinks and asked him how to get past the three headed dog  which Hagrid admits is easy ‚Äì music sends it to sleep  Realising that one of the Philosopher Stone defences is no longer secure  Harry goes to inform Professor Dumbledore  only to find that the headmaster has just left for an important meeting  Harry concludes that Snape faked the message that called Dumbledore away and will try to steal the Stone that night  Covered by the Invisibility Cloak  Harry and his two friends go to the three headed dog chamber  where Harry sends the beast to sleep by playing a flute given to him by Hagrid for Christmas  After lifting the trap door  they encounter a series of obstacles  each of which requires special skills possessed by one of the three  and one of which requires Ron to sacrifice himself in a game of wizard chess  In the final room Harry  now alone  finds Quirrell rather than Snape  Quirrell admits that he let in the troll that tried to kill Hermione on Halloween  and that he tried to kill Harry during the first Quidditch match but was knocked over by Hermione  Snape had been trying to protect Harry and suspected Quirrell  Quirrell serves Voldemort and  after failing to steal the Philosopher Stone from Gringotts  allowed his master to possess him in order to improve their chances of success  However the only other object in the room is the Mirror of Erised  and Quirrell can see no sign of the Stone  At Voldemort bidding  Quirrell forces Harry to stand in front of the Mirror  Harry feels the Stone drop into his pocket and tries to stall  Quirrell removes his turban  revealing the face of Voldemort on the back of his head  Voldemort/Quirrell tries to grab the Stone from Harry  but simply touching Harry causes Quirrell flesh to burn  After further struggles Harry passes out  He awakes in the school hospital  where Professor Dumbledore tells him that he survived because his mother sacrificed her life to protect him  and Voldemort could not understand the power of such love  Voldemort left Quirrell to die  and is likely to return by some other means  Dumbledore had foreseen that the Mirror would show Voldemort/Quirrell only themselves making the elixir of life  as they wanted to use the Philosopher Stone; Harry was able to see the Stone in the Mirror because he wanted to find it but not to use it  The Stone has now been destroyed  Harry returns to the Dursleys for the summer holiday  but does not tell them that under age wizards are forbidden to use magic outside Hogwarts  After ten years  Harry became an eleven year old boy  The Dursleys have kept the truth about Harry parents from him  but it is revealed in the form of Rubeus Hagrid  who tells Harry that he is a wizard and has been accepted at Hogwarts for the autumn term  Harry takes the

opposes his mother and refuses to take the throne  Adrian moves to Cumberland where Lionel  who bears a grudge against Adrian and his family for the neglect of the Verney family  intends to terrorise and confront Adrian  He is mollified by Adrian good nature and his explanation that he only recently discovered the letter  Lionel and Adrian become close friends  and Lionel becomes civilized and philosophical under Adrian influence  Lionel returns to England to face the personal turmoil amongst his acquaintances  Lord Raymond  who came to renown for his exploits in the war between Greece and

325,Now Wait for Last Year,Set during a war between the tarmen (inhabitants of the planet Lilistar) and the Reegs  Now Wait for Last Year is the story of Eric Sweetscent  an organ transplant doctor who gets wrapped up in Earth Lilistar politics  At the onset of the story  Sweetscent is the personal org trans surgeon for Virgil Ackerman  the president of Tijuana Fur & Dye  Using an extraterrestrial amoeba which can imitate the cell structure of anything it touches  TF&D had been the largest manufacturer of synthetic furs on the planet  But like all major corporations on Earth  TF&D has been requisitioned to produce for the war effort  Ackerman invites Sweetscent to Wash 35  a recreation of his boyhood native Washington DC in a simulated 1935 and his vacation getaway on Mars  where he announces an ulterior motive in the retreat  Waiting for them when they arrive is a guest‚ÄîGino Molinari  the elected leader of Earth  Known as the Mole  he is rumored to have the enigmatic ability to come back from the dead  and he has requested the services of Sweetscent  Ackerman gladly passes Sweetscent on to Molinari  Meanwhile  Sweetscent wife  Kathy  tries JJ 180  a new hallucinogenic drug which proves to be highly toxic and addictive  The effects of JJ 180 are not clear at first  however  only hours off of it  Kathy finds herself unable to function and violently craving JJ 180 again  She is visited by tarmen who claim the Reegs invented JJ 180 as a chemical weapon against the tarmen and Terrans  also stating that there is no known cure for the drug addiction and 'That why we put you on it'  Kathy is now a slave to JJ 180  The tarmen inform Kathy of her husband new position with Molinari and suspect the latter possible defection to the Reegs  Kathy is promised more JJ 180 if she agrees to spy on her husband for Lilistar  Threatened with deportation  Kathy capitulates and agrees to their terms  Eventually  she takes a second dose of the drug as her ability to function becomes nearly impossible due the effects of the withdrawal  Jumping into a taxi cab  both she and the cab are plunged back in time to the mid 20th century  As the effects of the drug wear off  they slowly make their way back to the present time  uncertain as to whether the past they visited was their own or an alternate one  An increasingly paranoid Kathy sets off to visit her husband  Under his new employer Eric Sweetscent is let in on certain State secrets: Molinari seems to have a psychosomatic condition that mirrors any illness or disease of anyone in his vicinity  The effects of this condition appear to be real  yet the Mole pulls through every time  always returning from the brink of death  Molinari  like everyone else  has realized that in siding with the tarmen Earth has doomed itself to the wrong side of a losing war  However  there does not seem to be any safe way of defecting to the Reegs  and Molinari fears that his deteriorating health will not instill confidence in the Terrans should the tarmen retaliate  as they are certain to do  Sweetscent is shown footage of a healthier  younger Molinari in uniform and is led to believe that an android look alike of the President has been created for public appearances  a notion that does not account for the fact that there is at least one other Molinari on the premises  a bullet ridden corpse that is being preserved for use in the event of certain possible future developments  Kathy arrives to inform her husband of her addiction  and in an effort to motivate him to find a cure she slips a pill of JJ 180 into his drink  Without enough time to be furious  Eric slips a year into the future of an alternate world where his colleagues inform him that he disappeared the day Kathy came to visit  Sweetscent also witnesses that in the new timeline Earth has sided with the Reegs and Lilistar has lost the war  Upon returning to the present of his own timeline  Sweetscent is eager to present this information to Molinari  who reveals that he too has been taking JJ 180  and that the effect is different for each user  Certain users are sent to the past  while others are sent to the future  Each trip is in an alternate universe  and therefore no one can effectively change their own past or future  However  aside from minor details  events in all observed universes seem to be moving in the same direction  and therefore  information obtained from one alternate world future will most likely be applicable to another  In Molinari case he slips sideways in time under the drug influence and is able to pull alternate versions of his present self into his own timeline and then keep them there  Having learned the secret to Molinari alter aliases as well as confirming the feasibility of an alliance with the Reegs  Eric takes a larger dose of JJ 180 which propels him further into the future  While there  he obtains a cure for JJ 180 addiction  an item of wide accessibility in the future  as well as obtaining more information about the possible future of the war in his own timeline  He also gathers information as to the effects of JJ 180 on the brain as he is increasingly worried about Kathy mental condition  Taking a fraction of a pill so as to not immediately return to his own time  Eric again ends up one year in his own future where the tarmen have occupied Earth after learning of the Terrans' defection to the Reegs  He is arrested by a tar patrol but saved by his future self  who informs him that Ackerman and the rest of the crew at TF&D have taken a stand against Lilistar  using Ackerman getaway on Mars as their hideout  Now knowing the general future history of the next few years  Eric returns to his own time where his wife mental condition is deteriorating every day  He resolves to check her into a clinic and is sent into deep reflection about the nature of their relationship  Feeling that he would be justified  he attempts to arrange an affair with a younger girl at Molinari recommendation  However  he backs out of it and begins to slip into a deep depression while reflecting on his life  He goes to Mexico to purchase poison with which to commit suicide  Deciding against it at the last second  Eric watches as the tarmen begin their invasion of Earth  Deciding that he is destined to join Ackerman resistance against the tarmen  Eric enters an automated cab bound for TF&D  asking it what it would do if its wife suffered from brain damage without possibility of recovery (which Eric had confirmed by contacting his future self)  After pointing out that robots do not marry  the cab hypothetically concludes that it would stay with her  Life  argues the cab  is made up of a series of circumstances  different for each person  To leave one wife would be to say that he requires a uniquely easier set of circumstances than what has been provided  That reasoning  to the cab  was an irrational way of thinking  Eric agrees and decides to stay with his wife despite the challenges presented by her condition  and in the closing paragraph he is thereby commended by the cab for being a 'good man'  fr:En attendant l'ann√©e derni√®re it:Illusione di potere

he finds Polly nearby  The woodland is filled with pools  Digory and Polly surmise that the world is not really a proper world at all but a Wood between the Worlds  similar to the attic that links their rowhouses back in England  and that each pool leads to a separate universe  They decide to explore a different world before returning to England  and jump into one of the nearby pools  They then find themselves in a desolate abandoned city of the ancient world of Charn  Inside the ruined palace  they discover statuesque figures of Charn former kings and queens  which degenerate from the fair and wise to the unhappy and cruel  They find a bell with a hammer  with these words: Make your choice  adventurous Stranger Strike the bell and bide the danger Or wonder  till it drives you mad What would have followed if you had Despite protests from Polly  Digory rings the bell  This awakens the last of the statues  a witch named Jadis  who  to avoid defeat in battle  had deliberately killed every living thing in Charn by speaking a &#34;Deplorable Word &#34; As the only survivor left in her world  she placed herself in an enchanted sleep that would only be broken by someone ringing the bell  The children realize Jadis&#39;s evil nature and attempt to flee  but she follows them back to England by clinging to them as they clutch their rings  In England  she dismisses Uncle Andrew as a mere dabbler in magic  She discovers that her magic does not work in England but she still has her strength  She enslaves Uncle Andrew and orders him to fetch her a chariot  so she can set about conquering Earth  They leave  and she returns standing atop a hansom with no driver  followed by a fire engine  There is a collision at the front door of the Kirke house  and police arrive  Jadis breaks off a rod from a nearby lamp post and brandishes it as a weapon  Polly and Digory grab her and put on their magic rings to take her out of their world  dragging with them Uncle Andrew  Frank the cab driver  and Frank&#39;s horse  since all were touching one another when Digory and Polly grabbed their rings  In the Wood between the Worlds they jump into a pool  hoping it leads back to Charn  Instead they stumble into a dark void that Jadis recognizes as a world not yet created  They then all witness the creation of a new world by the lion Aslan  who brings various entities  stars  plants  and animals  into existence as he sings  Jadis attempts to kill Aslan with the iron bar from the lamp post  but it deflects harmlessly off of him and begins to sprout into a new lamp post &#34;tree &#34; Jadis flees  Aslan gives some animals the power of speech  commanding them to use it for justice and merriment  Digory&#39;s uncle is frozen with fear and unable to communicate with the talking animals  who mistake him for a kind of tree  Aslan confronts Digory with his responsibility for bringing Jadis into his young world  and tells Digory he must atone by helping to protect Narnia from her evil  Aslan transforms the cabbie&#39;s horse into a winged horse named Fledge  and Digory and Polly fly on him to a garden high in the mountains  Digory&#39;s task is to take an apple from a tree in this garden  and plant it in Narnia  In the garden Digory finds a sign reading: Come in my gold gates or not at all Take of my fruit for others or forbear For those who steal or those who climb my wall Shall find their heart desire and find despair Digory picks one of the apples for his mission  but has to resist temptation to eat one for himself after he smells the apples  As he prepares to leave he is shocked to see the witch Jadis  She has eaten one of the magic apples  thereby becoming immortal  but her face is now &#34;deadly white;&#34; Digory begins to understand what the last line in the sign means  She tempts Digory to either eat an apple himself and join her in immortality  or steal one back to Earth to heal his dying mother  Digory resists temptation  knowing that his mother would never condone theft  However the clincher comes when the Witch suggests he leave Polly behind  not knowing Polly can get away by her own ring  At this  Digory sees through the Witch&#39;s ploy  Foiled  the Witch departs for the North  Digory returns to Narnia with an apple  which is planted in Narnian soil  A new tree springs up  which Aslan says will repel the Witch for centuries to come  Aslan informs Digory that a stolen apple would have healed his mother  but at a terrible price: anyone who steals the apples gets their heart&#39;s desire  but it comes in a form that makes it unlikeable  In the case of the Witch  she now has her heart&#39;s desire for immortality  but it only means eternal misery because of her evil heart  Moreover  the magic apples are now a horror to her  which is why the tree repels her  With Aslan&#39;s permission  Digory then takes an apple from the new tree to heal his mother  Aslan promises the apple will now bring joy  Aslan returns Digory  Polly  and Uncle Andrew to England; Frank and his wife  Helen (transported from England by Aslan) stay to rule Narnia as its first King and Queen  Digory&#39;s apple restores his dying mother to health  and he and Polly remain lifelong friends  Uncle Andrew reforms and gives up magic but he still enjoys bragging about his adventures with the Witch on their tour of London  Digory plants the apple&#39;s core  together with Uncle Andrew&#39;s magic rings  in the back yard of his aunt&#39;s home in London  Years later the tree that grows from it blows down in a storm  Digory has its wood made into a wardrobe  thus linking the story to The Lion  the Witch and the Wardrobe  in which Digory has become the old professor in whose country house Lucy Pevensie finds the wardrobe and the way into Narnia ,0,1,0,0,0

332,Stranger in a Strange Land,The story focuses on a human raised on Mars and his adaptation to  and understanding of  humans and their culture  which is portrayed as an amplified version of the consumerist and media driven 20th century United States  Protagonist Valentine Michael Smith is the son of astronauts of the first expedition to the planet Mars  Orphaned after the crew died  Smith was raised in the culture of the Martian natives  who possess full control over their minds and bodies (learned skills which Smith acquires)  A second expedition some twenty years later brings Smith to Earth  Because he is heir to the fortunes of the entire exploration party  which includes several valuable inventions (most particularly his mother Lyle Drive  which makes interplanetary travel economical)  Smith becomes a political pawn in government struggles  Moreover  despite the existence of the Martians  under terrestrial law Mars was terra nullius  wherefore according to some interpretations of law  Smith could be considered to own the planet Mars itself  Because Smith is unaccustomed to the atmosphere and gravity of Earth  he is confined at Bethesda Hospital  where having never seen a human female  he is attended by male staff only  Seeing this restriction as a challenge  Nurse Gillian Boardman eludes guards to see Smith and in doing so inadvertently becomes his first female water brother by sharing a glass of water with him  considered a holy relationship by the standards of arid Mars  When Gillian tells reporter Ben Caxton about her experience with Smith  they attempt to counteract the government lies about Smith  After Ben disappears at the behest of the World Government  Gillian persuades Smith to leave the hospital with her; but they are attacked by government agents  Smith discards the agents irretrievably into a fourth dimension  then is so shocked by Gillian terrified reaction that he enters a semblance of catatonia  Gillian  remembering Ben reference to Jubal Harshaw  a famous author who is also a physician and a lawyer  conveys Smith to the latter  Smith continues to demonstrate psychic abilities and superhuman intelligence coupled with a childlike na√Øvet√©  When Jubal tries to explain religion to him  Smith understands the concept of God only as one who groks  which includes every extant organism  This leads him to express the Martian concept of life as the phrase Thou art God  although he knows this is a bad translation  Many other human concepts such as war  clothing  and jealousy are strange to him  while the idea of an afterlife is a fact he takes for granted because the government on Mars is composed of Old Ones  the spirits of Martians who have died  It is also customary for loved ones and friends to eat the bodies of the dead  in a spirit of Holy Communion  Eventually Harshaw arranges freedom for Smith and recognition that human law  which would have granted ownership of Mars to Smith  has no applicability to a planet already inhabited by intelligent life  Now free to travel  Smith becomes a celebrity and is feted by the elite of Earth  He investigates many religions  including the Fosterite Church of the New Revelation  a populist megachurch wherein sexuality  gambling  alcoholism  and similar are not considered sinful but encouraged  even within the church building  The church is organized in a complexity of initiatory levels; an outer circle  open to the public; a middle circle of ordinary members who support the church financially; and an inner circle of the eternally saved ‚Äî attractive  highly sexed men and women  who serve as clergy and recruit new members  The Church owns many politicians and takes violent action against those who oppose it  Smith also has a brief career as a magician in a carnival  where he and Gillian befriend the show is tattooed lady  an eternally saved Fosterite woman named Patricia Paiwonski  Eventually Smith begets a Martian influenced Church of All Worlds combining elements of the Fosterite cult (especially the sexual aspects) with Western esotericism  whose members learn the Martian language and acquire psychokinetic abilities  The church is eventually besieged by Fosterites for practicing blasphemy and the church building destroyed; but Smith and his followers teleport to safety  Smith is arrested by the police  but escapes and returns to his followers  later explaining to Jubal that his gigantic fortune has been bequeathed to the Church  With it and their new abilities  Church members will be able to re organize human societies and cultures  Eventually those who cannot or will not learn Smith methods will die out  leaving Homo superior  Incidentally  this may save Earth from eventual destruction by the Martians  who we are told were responsible for the destruction of Planet V  Smith is killed by a mob raised against him by the Fosterites; but speaks briefly to Jubal from the afterlife  saving him from an attempted suicide after the horror of Smith own death  Having consumed Smith remains in keeping with his own wishes  Jubal and some of the Church members return to Jubal home to re create their former conditions  Meanwhile Smith re appears in the afterlife to replace the Fosterites' eponymous founder  amid hints that Smith was an incarnation of the Archangel Michael ,1,0,0,0,0

334,The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress,In 2075  underground colonies are scattered across the Moon (Luna)  of whom most inhabitants (called Loonies) are criminals  political exiles  or descendants thereof  The total population is about three million  with men outnumbering women 2:1  so that polyandry is the norm  Although Earth Protector of the Lunar Colonies (called the Warden) holds power  in practice there is little intervention in the loose Lunar society  HOLMES IV (High Optional  Logical  Multi Evaluating Supervisor  Mark IV) is the Lunar Authority master computer  having almost total control of Luna machinery on the grounds that a single computer is cheaper than (though not as safe as) multiple independent systems  The story is narrated by Manuel Garcia Mannie O'Kelly Davis  a computer technician who discovers that HOLMES IV has achieved self awareness and has developed a sense of humor  Mannie names it Mike after Mycroft Holmes  brother of Sherlock Holmes  and they become friends  At the beginning of the story  Mannie  at Mike request  places a recorder in an anti Authority meeting  When the authorities raid the gathering  Mannie flees with Wyoming (Wyoh) Knott  a statuesque blonde agitator  whom he introduces to Mike and with whom he goes to see his former teacher  the elderly Professor Bernardo de la Paz  who claims that Luna must stop exporting hydroponic wheat to Earth or its resources will be exhausted  In connection with this  Mike calculates that if no prevention occurs  there will be food riots in seven years and cannibalism in nine  Wyoh and the Professor decide to start a revolution  which Mannie is persuaded to join at Mike behest  Mannie  Wyoh  and de la Paz thereafter form covert cells  protected by Mike  who adopts the persona of Adam Selene  leader of the movement  and communicates via the telephone system  Mannie saves the life of Stuart Rene LaJoie  a rich  well connected  sympathetic tourist  who begins turning public opinion on Earth in favor of lunar independence  When soldiers brought to quell the mounting unrest rape and kill a local young woman  then kill another who finds her body  rioting erupts  The Loonies overcome military opposition and overthrow the Lunar Authority Protector  called the Warden  When Earth tries to reclaim the colony  the revolutionaries plan to use in defense a smaller duplicate of the electromagnetic catapult formerly used to export wheat  Mike impersonates the Warden in messages to Earth  to give the revolution time to organize their work  Meanwhile  the Professor sets up an Ad Hoc Congress to distract dissenters  When Earth finally learns the truth  Luna declares its independence on July 4  2076  the 300th anniversary of the United States' Declaration of Independence  Mannie and the Professor go to Earth to plead Luna case  where they are received in Agra by the Federated Nations  and embark on a world tour advertising the benefits of a free Luna  while urging various governments to build a catapult to transfer supplies to Luna in exchange for grain  Their proposals are rejected and they are imprisoned; but they are freed by Stuart LaJoie and returned  with him  to Luna  Public opinion on Earth has become fragmented  while on Luna the news of Mannie arrest and the attempt to bribe him with the appointment of himself as Warden have unified the normally fractious Loonies  An election is held in which Mannie  Wyoh  and the Professor are elected (possibly by the intervention of Mike)  (The title is an acronym for There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch!) The Federated Nations on Earth send armies to destroy the Lunar revolution; but these are vanquished  with great loss of life  by the revolutionaries  The rumor is circulated that Mike alter ego Adam Selene was among those killed; thus removing the need for him to appear in the flesh  When Mike launches rocks at sparsely populated locations on Earth  warnings are released to the press detailing the times and locations of the bombings; but disbelieving people  as well as people on religious pilgrimages  travel to the sites and die  As a result  public opinion turns against the fledgling nation  A second attack destroys Mike original catapult; but the Loonies have built a secondary smaller one in a secret location  and with Mannie acting as its on site commander  the Loonies continue to attack Earth until it concedes Luna independence  Professor Bernardo de la Paz  as leader of the nation  proclaims victory to the gathered crowds; but collapses and dies  Mannie takes control; but he and Wyoh eventually withdraw from politics altogether  and find that the new government falls short of their expectations  When Mannie tries to speak to Mike afterwards  the latter replies indicate that the computer has lost its self awareness and its human like qualities  as a result either of damage suffered in the war or of shock undergone therein ,1,0,0,0,0

337,Methuselah Children,The Howard Families derive from Ira Howard  who became rich in the California Gold Rush  but died young and childless  Fearing death  he left his money for the prolongation of human life  and the trustees of his will carried out his wishes by financially encouraging those with long lived grandparents to marry and have children  While the Families (who  by the 22nd Century  have a life expectancy of 150 years) have kept their existence secret  with the enlightened human society established under The Covenant  they decide to reveal themselves  Society refuses to believe the Howard Families simply 'chose their ancestors wisely'  instead insisting they have developed a method to extend life  and the Families are persecuted and interned  Though the beleaguered Administrator of the planet  Slayton Ford  is convinced the Families are telling the truth  he is helpless to control an increasingly irrational public and their efforts to force the Howard Families to reveal their secret or face execution  The eldest member of the Howard Families  Lazarus Long  realizes this as well  and proposes to the Administrator that he help the Families hijack the colony starship New Frontiers  so they can escape  In the process of escaping  they are driven too near the Sun by military spacecraft  When they are a few minutes away from overheating  Heinlein invokes a deus ex machina: it turns out that one member of the Families  Andrew Jackson Libby  (known as Slipstick Libby because he is a mathematical genius)  has managed to invent a device that removes inertia from any mass to which it is attached  Libby applies the device  and instantaneously  New Frontiers is accelerated by light pressure from the Sun to nearly the speed of light  The Families leave the Solar System  with the deposed Ford joining them at the last minute  The first planet they discover has humanoid inhabitants who seem friendly and advanced   however  they are merely domesticated animals belonging to the planet true masters  indescribable beings of equally indescribable power  When humans prove incapable of similar domestication  they are expelled from the planet and sent to another world  The second planet is a lush environment with no predators and mild weather  Its inhabitants are part of a group mind  with the mental ability to manipulate the environment on the genetic and molecular level  They have no independent personalities; anyone who joins the group mind ceases to exist as a unique individual  This becomes evident when Mary Sperling  second oldest of the Families  who has always been fearful of death  joins the group mind in an attempt to become truly immortal  The Families are further horrified when the group mind  in a mistaken effort to be helpful  genetically modifies the first baby born on the planet into a new  alien form  Lazarus calls a meeting of the Families  He states that humans are what they are because they are individuals  and that they have no place on this world  The Families vote  and a majority of the Families decide to go back to Earth and claim their rights  Libby  with the help of the group mind  builds a new faster than light drive that will take them home in months instead of years  The Families return to the Solar System seventy five years after their original departure  To their surprise they find that on Earth great longevity is commonplace  Spurred on by the belief that there was a specific technique to the Howards' longevity  Earth scientists developed a series of treatments that extended lifespans to several centuries  The Families are now free to return  and are even welcomed due to their discovery of faster than light travel  Thanks to humanity increased lifespan  the Solar System is overcrowded; faster than light travel will allow emigrants to ease the population explosion  Libby and Long decide to recruit other members of the Families  and explore space with the new drive ,1,0,0,0,0

340,Consider Phlebas,The Culture and the Idiran Empire are at war in a galaxy spanning conflict  Horza  a mercenary capable of altering his appearance at will (a Changer)  is assigned the task of retrieving a dispossessed Culture Mind by his Idiran handlers  The Mind  while fleeing attacking Idirans who consider its existence an abomination  has taken refuge on Schar World  a Planet of the Dead  Planets of the Dead are nominally forbidden to both the Culture and the Idirans  being under the control of god like incorporeal beings called Dra'Azon  Horza  however  was one of a group of Changers allowed to be on the planet as stewards and witnesses to its devastation  He may be the only person in the Galaxy  and certainly the only one known to the Idirans  who would be allowed to return  On the way to Schar World he encounters  and joins  a band of mercenaries and pirates  led by Kraiklyn  on their ship  the Clear Air Turbulence  All the while he is doggedly pursued by a Culture Special Circumstances agent  Perosteck Balveda  The Culture also realizes that Horza is the key to getting to Schar World and retrieving the Mind  Their plan is to place an agent with him and hope that the agent can get to the Mind first and somehow leave with it  The plot takes many digressions on the way to the denouement  As the book opens  Horza is about to die an extremely unpleasant death after killing and impersonating a member of the gerontocracy on a world not yet part of the Culture  Here he meets Balveda for the first time  He is rescued by the Idirans and given his mission to find the Culture Mind  but the Idiran ship on which he is travelling is soon captured by a Culture ship  Drifting in an escape suit  he is picked up by an independent ship  the Clear Air Turbulence  crewed by a Free Company of mercenaries  and he has to fight and kill one of them (while still in the form of a very old man) in order to prevent them dumping him back into space  Horza soon resolves to take over the ship by replacing the Captain  Kraiklyn  who leads them on some disastrous pirate raids which kill several of the crew  The first raid backfires because the team is unaware that the temple they plan to rob has been built of laser reflecting crystal  which turns their beams back on themselves  The next raid takes place on the Orbital Vavatch  a massive artificial ringworld 14 million kilometres in diameter  which the Culture is about to destroy to prevent the Idirans taking it over  The crew lands on an abandoned Megaliner cruising the Vavatch ocean  hoping to salvage its powerful laser weapons before the Orbital is destroyed  but one of the crew is killed soon after landing because he missed the briefing warning them that their antigravity devices would not work there  and more die when the ship crashes into a massive ice wall  which Kraiklyn had mistaken for a cloud bank  although Horza later discovers that Kraiklyn and several others managed to escape  Horza flees the disaster in the damaged CAT shuttle  but it crashes into the sea near an isolated island  killing the pilot  There he is taken prisoner by a bizarre cult  led by a monstrously obese homicidal cannibal  whose followers subsist on food that has been cooked to remove almost all nutritive value and mixed with effluent  Horza escapes his impending sacrifice by killing the cult leader and his henchman with his poisoned fingernails and teeth  and eventually makes his way to the main city on Vavatch to find Kraiklyn  Having now changed his appearance to mimic that of the CAT captain  Horza witnesses a game of Damage  which Kraiklyn has joined in the hopes of winning enough to make up the losses from his foolhardy expeditions with the crew  Damage is a card game enhanced with psychological and emotional pressure by direct mind to mind contact  where the tokens of play are actual living beings who are killed when a player loses a round  The game is illegal and only played in places where the normal order is breaking down  as in the case of Vavatch  which is being evacuated  Kraiklyn is wiped out of the game  and Horza then follows him on his way back to his ship  kills him and returns to the CAT  There  to his dismay  he is introduced to the newest crew member   although disguised  he immediately recognises her as Perosteck Balveda  Just as Horza immobilises her with a stun gun  Culture agents outside try to capture the ship  Horza manages to lift off and takes the Clear Air Turbulence on a wild ride through the massive spaces of the ex Culture GSV which is carrying out the evacuation  and they escape into space after shaking off their Culture pursuers  although a Culture drone  Unaha Closp  is also trapped on the escaping ship and becomes a reluctant member of the team  As the fugitives warp away from Vavatch  they see the Orbital destroyed by the Culture warships  Balveda  now exposed as a Culture agent  in turn exposes Horza; seeing no reason to continue his deception  he instead recruits the remnants of the crew to carry out his mission  The final chapters are action packed  Horza and his crew land on Schar World and go in search for the Mind in the labyrinthine Command System  a vast subterranean complex built as a nuclear warfare command centre (ultimately  though  it was germ warfare which wiped out all life on the Planet of the Dead)  They soon discover that the Mind is also being hunted by a pair of Idiran soldiers  survivors of a larger commando group  who have killed all the Changers stationed on the planet  and who regard Horza and his crew as enemies  having no knowledge of the Changers' alliance with the Idirans  Horza has kept Balveda alive  possibly as a hostage  and she goes along with the mission  awaiting her chance to swing the outcome in the Culture favour  Horza situation is further complicated when his crewmate Yalson reveals that she is pregnant to him  The Free Company encounter the Idirans in one of the Command System stations but after an intense firefight  they apparently kill one and manage to capture the other  After tracking the Mind to another station  the drone Unaha Closp discovers it hiding in the reactor car of a Command System train  but while the team are distracted  the captured Idiran  Xoxarle  frees itself  kills the guard and sets an ambush for the others  Meanwhile  the second Idiran  who was mortally wounded but not killed  has managed to set one of the trains for a collision course  and as it smashes into the station  Xoxarle springs his ambush  and Yalson is killed  The enraged Horza pursues Xoxarle  who catches Balveda and leaves her for dead  although she is saved by Horza  In the climactic fight  Horza is overwhelmed  but thanks to the combined action of the drone and Balveda  Xoxarle is finally killed  Although the Mind has been rescued the cost has been terrible   all the crew of the Clear Air Turbulence have been killed  the drone is severely damaged  and the fatally wounded Horza dies just as Balveda gets him back to the surface ,1,0,0,0,0
341,Inversions,The book takes place on a fictional planet based on late Middle Ages Europe  It alternates chapter by chapter between two concurrent storylines  The first storyline is presented as a written account from Oelph  publicly a doctor assistant  but privately a spy for an individual identified only as Master  to whom much of the account is addressed  Oelph is the assistant to Vosill  the personal doctor to King Quience of Haspidus and a woman  The latter is unheard of in the patriarchal kingdom  and is tolerated only because Vosill claims citizenship in the far off country of Drezen  The King himself is appreciative of her and her talents  but nonetheless her elevated position in defiance of the kingdom social mores inspires hostility among others of the court  Oelph account follows Vosill as she attends to the King regularly  as well as more charitable ministrations to the impoverished and those in need  Her methods are unconventional by kingdom standards  for example forgoing the use of leeches and instead using alcohol to [kill] the ill humours which can infect a wound  but are more often than not successful  This only serves to inspire more distrust amongst her detractors  notably including a number of Dukes as well as the King Guard Commander  Adlain  On this topic  Oelph includes a transcript he claims to have found in Vosill journal  purported to be an exchange between Duke Walen and Adlain in which they make an agreement  should it become necessary  to covertly kidnap the lady doctor and have Nolieti  the King chief torturer  put her to the question  Oelph notes that while the transcript appears to have been obtained under impossible circumstances  he somehow does not doubt its veracity  While Vosill attends to the King  Nolieti is murdered  nearly decapitated  presumably by his assistant Unoure  Vosill examines the body and determines that Unoure could not have killed his master  but her explanation is disregarded  Unoure is captured  but before he can be questioned he is found in his cell dead from a cut throat  apparently self inflicted  Following this account Oelph includes another found transcript  this time between Walen and Duke Quettil  though Walen is unable to obtain Quettil agreement for the use of Ralinge  his own chief torturer  in Walen kidnapping plan  Some days later at a masked ball Walen is found murdered  this time by a stab to the heart  The Duke murder disquiets much of the royal house  as it occurred in a room no one entered or left  Resentment towards Vosill continues to build  particularly after King Quience begins implementing somewhat radical reforms  such as permitting commoners to own farmland without the oversight of a noble  reforms which Vosill has discussed with the King publicly and at length  Following these reforms Vosill confesses to the King that she loves him  a sentiment he rebuffs  and further hurts her when he states that he prefers pretty  dainty  delicate women who [have] no brains  Oelph finds her after this  drunk  and hints at his own feelings of love towards her; she rebuffs him as well  albeit gently  Some days later Vosill receives a note from Adlain  asking her to meet him and two other Dukes elsewhere in the castle  She leaves alone  but Oelph opts to follow her in secret; he arrives in time to see her stumble across the body of a murdered Duke  stabbed with one of her scalpels  and catches a glimpse of the real murderer fleeing the room  Vosill and Oelph are almost immediately taken into custody by guards and delivered to Ralinge  who binds the two to separately and then strips  intending to rape Vosill  The woman issues what sounds to Oelph like commands  albeit in a language he does not recognize even partially  Oelph eyes are closed at this point  and in his narrative he is unable to adequately describe what he hears next  other than an impression of wind and metal  When he opens his eyes he finds Ralinge and his assistants dead  dispatched bloodily  and Vosill free and in the process of removing his bindings  no indication of how she was freed  Later  she claims that Oelph fell unconscious and the three men fought over who would rape her first  though she indicates to him that this is what he should remember  The two are taken from the torturer chamber shortly thereafter  as the King has abruptly taken ill and appears to be dying  Vosill is able to cure King Quience condition  and is there to witness as the conspiracy against her is revealed to the King  inadvertently  when news of Ralinge death reaches the conspirators: Commander Adlain and Dukes Quettil and Ulresile  Ultimately the blame is publicly taken by Ulresile  who escapes with being exiled for several months; the King makes it clear that further plots against the doctor will not be tolerated  Because Oelph is not present for these events  his account comes second hand from his master  revealed to be Guard Commander Adlain  Vosill requests the King release her from her duties  which he does  She leaves just a few days later on a ship for Drezen  and is seen off at the dock by Oelph  Though he tries  he cannot bring himself to bluntly declare his love for her before she boards  The ship leaves sometime later  Vosill nowhere to be seen on board  The second  interleaved storyline is told by an initially unnamed narrator  remaining unnamed so as to provide a neutral context for the narrative  The story focuses on DeWar  bodyguard to General UrLeyn  the Prime Protector of the Protectorate of Tassasen  Protector UrLeyn is the leader of Tassasen  having killed the previous monarch in a revolt; subsequently he eliminated official terms such as King and Empire within Tassasen  At the beginning of the story the Protectorate is fast approaching a war with the neighboring land of Ladenscion  led by barons who initially supported UrLeyn revolution but now intend to establish themselves as independent  DeWar is the sometimes confidant of UrLeyn  but the bodyguard also maintains a friendly  conversational relationship with Perrund  a member of the Tassasen harem  Perrund was once the Protector prized concubine  which changed following an assassination attempt on UrLeyn; Perrund shielded the Protector with her body  saving his life at the cost of crippling her left arm  Though no longer as prized as a concubine  Perrund is highly regarded by UrLeyn  DeWar  and most of Tassasen society  DeWar in particular finds her easy to confide in  and spends much of his off time playing board games with her while the two tell each other stories  DeWar is on high alert as the conflict with Ladenscion approaches  believing that someone within the court may be a traitor  An attempt is made on UrLeyn life by an assassin disguised as an ambassador  though DeWar anticipates the threat and kills the man before he can succeed  Nonetheless  this act only reinforces DeWar fears of a traitor  A surprising  unwelcome turn comes when UrLeyn young son  Lattens  has a seizure and subsequently falls ill  While the boy slowly recovers  DeWar tells him stories of a magical land called Lavishia  a place where every man was a king  every woman a queen  Eventually the boy recovers  and UrLeyn and his bodyguard depart for the front lines  where the war with Ladenscion is flagging  However  no sooner they are there than word arrives that Lattens has fallen ill again  prompting a distraught UrLeyn to rush back to the castle  While DeWar is gone  Perrund tells Lattens a story about a girl named Dawn  who spent most of her life locked in a basement by her cruel family and was eventually rescued by a traveling circus  When he returns  Perrund tells DeWar about the story  then tells him it was a shadow of the real story: her story  Rather than her parents locking her in the basement to be cruel  they locked her in to hide her from Imperial soldiers‚Äîhigh ranking men of the former King regime  Rather than being rescued  the soldiers found her  raped her  her mother and her sisters  and then forced her to watch as they murdered her father and brothers  The soldiers were eventually killed  but Perrund still feels she is now dead inside  DeWar attempts to in some way comfort her  but she quickly demands he return her to the harem  Lattens' condition continues to worsen  causing UrLeyn to act more and more erratically  spending less time focusing on the war and more time at his son bedside  The Protector goes so far as to bar all visitors to his chambers  and even prohibits DeWar from speaking to him unless he is spoken to  His only real contact is with Perrund  who spends most nights holding UrLeyn as he cries himself to sleep  DeWar enlists Perrund help in focusing UrLeyn on the war  but to no success  An epiphany strikes DeWar when he finds he has drooled on his pillow in his sleep  and he proceeds to Lattens' room  A guard restrains the boy nurse while DeWar examines his comforter  finding it has been soaked in an unknown fluid  presumably poison  Under threat of death the nurse reveals who has been orchestrating the poisoning: Perrund  DeWar storms into the harem chambers  intent on revealing the conspiracy to UrLeyn  but arrives too late; Perrund has already killed the Protector  and calmly waits for the bodyguard  Holding her at swordpoint  DeWar tearfully demands to know why she conspired against the Protector  Perrund replies that she did it for revenge  for killing her and her family  The soldiers who raped her were not the former King men at all  not even men allied to UrLeyn  but the man himself  as well as his current  closest advisers  Afterward she was taken in by men from Haspidus  and recruited as a spy by King Quience directly  Saving UrLeyn from the assassin was simply to prevent him from dying while he was a strong leader; instead  her orders were to ensure he died in utter ruin  After her confession  Perrund demands DeWar kill her  He silently refuses  lowering his sword  Perrund grabs his knife and brings it to her own throat  but it is quickly knocked away by DeWar blade  which he lowers once more  Oelph gives a brief  personal epilogue for both stories  The three conspirators who attempted to kill Vosill died of various diseases  only Adlain lasting longer than a few years  King Quience reigned for 40 years before his death  and was succeeded by one of his many daughters  giving the kingdom its first ruling Queen  Vosill disappeared from the ship she departed on; her disappearance was only discovered after a sudden burst of wind and chain fire struck the ship  then vanished as quickly  Attempts to notify Vosill family in Drezen were unsuccessful: nobody in the island country could be found who had ever met her  Oelph himself became a doctor  eventually taking Vosill post as the royal physician  Tassasen endured a civil war after the death of Protector UrLeyn; eventually King Lattens took control of the Empire  ruling it quietly  Oelph explains that he stopped DeWar story as he did because that is where versions of the story differ dramatically  The more popular version has DeWar personally execute Perrund  followed by a return to the Half Hidden Kingdoms where he reclaims his hidden title as Prince  and eventually King  A second version  supposedly written by Perrund herself  instead has DeWar telling the waiting guards and staff that UrLeyn is fine but sleeping  this and other distractions providing enough time for him and the former concubine to flee Tassasen before the Protector body is discovered  The two elude capture and arrive in the Half Hidden Kingdoms  eventually marry  have several children  and die many years later in an avalanche in the mountains  Finally  Oelph ends his epilogue by revealing that he expects his wife  whom he loves dearly  to return soon  quite possibly with his grandchildren accompanying her ,1,0,0,0,0

he gets into a fight with a fellow student  Stilson  Though the smaller and weaker of the two  Ender manages to fatally wound Stilson (though Ender is unaware of this and believes he merely injured the other boy)  When explaining his actions to IF Commander Hyrum Graff  Ender states his belief that  by showing superiority now  he will have prevented further fights in the future  Graff  on hearing of this  promptly offers Ender a place in the Battle School  situated in Earth orbit  Ender accepts and is taken away from his parents  who have no say in the matter  Initially  Ender believes Graff is a potential friend and ally  unaware of the fact Graff believes Ender is Earth last great hope in defending it from a Formic attack  In order to ensure Ender develops as a strong leader uninfluenced by his peers  Graff isolates him from the rest of the new cadets by acknowledging his intelligence and ridiculing his peers  Between being ostracized by his fellow cadets and having troubling dreams about Formics  Ender is soon ready to quit the school  but Graff encourages him through communications sent from Valentine  Among other training methods  the cadets participate in a competitive squad based war simulation in zero gravity  Ender is quick to acclimate to the new environment and demonstrates tactics not previously seen by the students and supervisors  He is able to lead his squad to victory and other squads are quick to add Ender tactics to their own  Ender is soon promoted to be leader of his own squad  formed from the most recent and youngest cadets at the school  Despite their inexperience as well as an increasing difficulty of the games  Ender devises new tactics and his squad soon excels and leads the competition  No longer an outsider  Ender becomes friends with several of his cadets  forming Ender jeesh  A fellow squad leader  Bonzo de Madrid  furious at Ender victories  attacks Ender with the intent to kill him  Ender manages to outmaneuver Bonzo in the fight  and fatally wounds him  Back on Earth  Peter has used a global communication system to post political essays under the pseudonym Locke  hoping to establish himself as a respected orator (which he believes will shortly lead him to political power despite his youth)  Valentine  while not trusting Peter  believes that his methods are sound for affecting world politics in a positive manner  She becomes complicit in Peter actions by posting works alongside his as Demosthenes  Their essays are soon taken seriously by people at the highest positions of power in the government  Though Graff discovers the true identities  he keeps this a secret to himself believing the knowledge might one day prove useful  Ender is soon promoted to Command School  skipping several years of schooling  There  he is put directly under watch of a former Formic war hero  Mazer Rackham  Alongside other rigorous training  Mazer tests Ender with a war simulator  pitting virtual IF fleets under Ender control against Formic fleets controlled by Mazer  Ender adapts to the game and  as the simulations become harder  Ender is given sub commanders  members of his jeesh  to work alongside him  Ender is brought to the simulator  with several IF commanders watching  and told by Mazer this is his final test  As the simulation starts  Ender finds his human fleet far outnumbered by the Formic forces above a planet  Despite being told that it was against the rules  Ender sacrifices most of his fighters fleet to launch a Molecular Disruption Device at the planet  destroying the planet and the entire Formic fleet  Though Ender had anticipated that breaking the rules would mean he would be expelled from school  he discovers the IF commanders celebrating  Mazer returns  and informs Ender that this was not a simulation  but the actual IF contingent and the Formic main fleet at the Formic homeworld: Ender has just destroyed the Formic homeworld and committed xenocide of the Formics  ending the war  Ender enters into a deep depression on learning of this  as well as of the deaths of Stilson and Bonzo  When he recovers  he finds himself still in orbit with Valentine and learns that  on the end of the Formic war  Earth went to war with itself  Valentine apologizes that Ender can never return to Earth  as he would be too powerful a tool to be used by the various leaders  including Peter  Instead  Ender joins an Earth colony program to populate one of the former Formic colony worlds  There  as he scouts the planet  he finds an area shockingly similar to a simulated game from Battle School  Exploring the area leads him to discover the dormant egg of a Formic queen  The queen  through telepathy  explains that the Formics had initially assumed humans were a non sentient race due to a lack of hive mind  but realized their mistake too late  They could not communicate with the humans as war broke out  but were able to touch Ender mind  creating the dreams he felt and preparing this place for him  The queen requests that Ender take the egg to a new planet to allow the Formic race to grow again  Ender takes the egg and  with information from the Queen  writes The Hive Queen under the alias Speaker for the Dead  Peter  now the Hegemon of Earth  recognizes Ender hand behind the work and requests Ender to write a book about Peter  which Ender entitles Hegemon  The combined works create a new religion that Earth and many of Earth colonies start to adopt it  In the end  Ender and Valentine board a starship and start visiting many worlds  looking for the right one for the unborn Queen ,1,0,0,0,0

350,Foundation Edge,Five hundred years after the establishment of the Foundation  the Mayor of Terminus  Harla Branno  is basking in a political glow  her policies having been vindicated by the recent successful resolution of a Seldon Crisis  Golan Trevize  a former officer of the Navy and now a member of Council  believes the Second Foundation (which is almost universally thought to be extinct) still exists and is controlling events  He attempts to question the continued existence of the Seldon Plan during a Council session and Branno has him arrested on a charge of treason  She orders him to leave Terminus to search for the Second Foundation  As a cover  he is to be accompanied by Janov Pelorat  a professor of Ancient History and mythologist  who is interested in the location of Earth  the fabled homeworld of humanity  They are provided a highly advanced computer controlled 'gravitic' ship with which to carry out their mission  Branno also sends out Munn Li Compor in another similar vessel to follow and monitor Trevize  On Trantor  Stor Gendibal  a rising intellect in the Second Foundation hierarchy  discovers a secret he reveals to Quindor Shandess  the current First Speaker &mdash; that the Seldon Plan  which the Second Foundation diligently protects and furthers along  is being manipulated by some unknown group  one possibly more powerful than the Second Foundation  and whose reasons for so doing are not known  (This group is dubbed the Anti Mules by Shandess  as they seem to possess powers similar to the Mule but to be using them not to destroy the Seldon Plan  as the Mule did  but to preserve it ) Gendibal concludes that Trevize is a lightning rod sent out to locate and expose the Second Foundation  His ideas are not well received by the other Speakers  but he has the support of Shandess  Trevize never intends to go to Trantor believing  that once at the library  Pelorat will never leave  Trevize and Pelorat discuss Pelorat interest in Earth and its legends  and Trevize realizes that Seldon phrase at the other end of the Galaxy (the phrase he used to describe the Second Foundation location) could mean Earth  His logic being that Terminus (at the time of Hari Seldon) was the last planet to be inhabited (one end of the metaphorical galaxy) and  by definition  Earth was the first (the other end of the metaphorical galaxy)  However  there is no planet named Earth in the galactic table of planets  Pelorat  through his previous research  established characteristics that Earth must have: a 24 hour day  a 365 day year  and a large satellite  Once again no planet on file has these characteristics  but the galactic table of planets is missing a lot of information about a lot of planets  Nonetheless  Pelorat has a guess  The table mentions a planet called Gaia which Pelorat discovered  previously  to mean Earth  Its exact coordinates are unknown but it is listed as being in the Sayshell Sector  Trevize decides that they must go to the Sayshell Sector to follow up on this lead  Gendibal demonstrates to the Speaker Table that the brain of Sura Novi  a Hamishwoman (the farming population of Trantor are known as the Hamish)  shows a very subtle change in her mind that could only have been done by an agency more powerful than the Second Foundation  He believes it was done by the Anti Mules and that they have a separate agenda with the Second Foundation as their unwitting pawn  Gendibal and Novi are sent to track Trevize and to determine the goals of the Anti Mules  On Sayshell  Trevize and Pelorat meet Professor Quintesetz  who is able to give them the co ordinates to the mysterious planet known as Gaia  Traveling to Gaia  they discover that it is a uperorganism'  where all things  both living and inanimate  participate in a larger  group consciousness  while still retaining any individual awareness they might have  such as among the Gaian humans  Pelorat slowly falls in love with a Gaian woman named Blissenobiarella (commonly called Bliss)  who explains that Trevize will be forced to decide the future of the galaxy &mdash; whether it will be ruled by the First Foundation  the Second Foundation  or by Gaia (who envisions an eventual extension of its group consciousness to the entire galaxy  thus forming the new entity Galaxia)  Gendibal is met by a First Foundation warship  commanded by Mayor Branno  As Gendibal mental powers stalemate with Mayor Branno force shield  Novi reveals herself as an agent of Gaia  Once she joins the stalemate  the three are locked until Trevize can join them  Bliss explains to Trevize that he had been led to Gaia so that his untouched mind  a mind with remarkable intuition  can decide the Galaxy fate  He also learns that the stalemate between the First Foundation (Branno)  the Second Foundation (Gendibal)  and Gaia (Novi) was intentional  and that through the ship computer  he can decide who shall ultimately prove victorious  Trevize decides upon Gaia  and through mental adjustments  Gaia makes Branno and Gendibal believe they have won minor victories  and that Gaia does not exist  But Trevize is troubled by one final piece of missing information: who or what has removed all reference to Earth from the Galactic Library at Trantor  and why  He announces his intention to find Earth  since without knowing the answers to those questions he cannot be certain his choice was the right one  Trevize also mentions that he chose Gaia because that was the only choice of the three that was not irreversible (in case his choice should prove to be wrong)  due to the large length of time required for the formation of Galaxia ,1,0,0,0,0

352,Prelude to Foundation, The story takes place on Trantor during the reign of Emperor Cleon I  It starts with Hari presentation of a paper at a mathematics convention detailing how practical use of psychohistory might theoretically be possible  The Emperor of the Galactic Empire learns of this and wants to use Hari for political gain  After an interview with Hari  however  Cleon concludes that Hari is of no use to the Empire  Hari then meets reporter Chetter Hummin  who convinces him that Cleon first minister Eto Demerzel is attempting to capture him  and that it is therefore imperative for Hari to escape and to try to make psychohistory practical  Thus  Hari goes on his Flight and is introduced to Dors Venabili by Hummin  Hari and Dors narrowly evade capture at Streeling University  following which the pair move to Mycogen  Hari and Dors are welcomed to Mycogen by Sunmaster Fourteen  the leader of Mycogen  Determined to work out his psychohistory with the knowledge that the Mycogenians supposedly possess  Hari decides to speak to a Mycogenian alone about history  He manages this by convincing Raindrop Forty three to show him the prized Mycogenian microfarms  a prized source of food for the aristocracy and Mycogenians alike  When Hari inquires about that the peculiar Mycogenian ways might be the product of religious belief  Raindrop Forty three is offended and says that the Mycogenians have something better: History  Hari inquires into the source of Mycogenian history and Raindrop Forty three reveals that it is encompassed in The book  Hari asks for the book but Raindrop Forty three accepts on the condition that Hari allows her to touch his hair; (hair being expressively forbidden in Mycogenian society)  When Hari starts reading the book  he finds it disappointing except for the revealing of what the Mycogenians call their home planet  Aurora  Hari and Dors are almost killed when they try to find what they suspect is a robot in the Mycogenian temple until Hummin arrives in the nick of time to save them  The action then shifts to the Dahl sector  where Dors displays her amazing knife fighting skills  While in Dahl they meet a guttersnipe named Raych (whom Hari later adopts as his son)  and Yugo Amaryl (who would become Hari partner in developing psychohistory)  Towards the end of the novel  Hari  Dors  and Raych are kidnapped by agents from Wye  a powerful sector situated at Trantor south pole  The finale reveals that Hummin is actually Cleon first minister Eto Demerzel  who we later learn is in fact the robot R  Daneel Olivaw  By the end of the novel  Hari suspects that Dors is a robot  too  This theme would later be picked up in Forward the Foundation ,1,0,0,0,0

Earth  The purpose of the journey is to settle Trevize doubt with his decision at the end of Foundation Edge to embrace the all encompassing supermind of Galaxia  First  they journey to Comporellon  which claims to be the oldest currently inhabited planet in the galaxy  Although many other planets make that claim  Comporellon has a very long history with which to back it up  Upon arrival  they are imprisoned  but negotiate their way out  While there  they find the coordinates of three Spacer planets  Since the Spacers were the first colonists from Earth back in the ancient days of space travel  it is surmised that their planets would be fairly close to Earth  The first Spacer planet they visit is Aurora  where Trevize is nearly killed by a pack of wild dogs  presumed to be the descendants of household pets long since reverted to wolf like savagery  They escape when Bliss manipulates the dogs' emotions to psychologically compel a retreat  while Trevize uses his neuronic whip on them  Next  they go to Solaria  where they find that the Solarians ‚Äî who have survived the Spacer Settler conflicts by clever retreat detailed in Asimov novel Robots and Empire ‚Äî have engineered themselves into self reproducing hermaphrodite beings  who have remained generally intolerant of human physical presence or contact  They have also given themselves a natural ability to mentally channel (transduce) great amounts of energy  and utilize this as their sole source of power  The Solarians intentionally avoid ever having to interact with each other  except by holographic apparatus (viewing)  and reproduce only when necessary to replace someone who has died  Bliss  Pelorat  and Trevize are nearly killed by a Solarian named Sarton Bander  Bliss  however  deflects the transducer brain lobes at the moment Bander tries to use them to kill  Bliss intends to knock out Bander  but has not had sufficient time to learn the full workings of the transducer and accidentally kills it instead  While escaping  they find what they assume to be Bander immature child  Fallom  in a state of panic because its robotic nursemaid  like all other robots on the estate  has stopped functioning  The child Fallom cannot inherit the Bander estate  as would normally be the Solarian custom  because it is too immature to be able to use its transducer lobes  There being no other place for the child on Solaria  the decision of the robots who immediately arrive to investigate the loss of power is that Fallom is to be destroyed  Upon learning this  Bliss insists that they take Fallom with them  They next go to Melpomenia  the third and final Spacer coordinate they have  They find that the atmosphere has become depressurized to a few thousandths of normal atmospheric pressure  Wearing space suits  they enter a library  and find a statue  as well as writings with the coordinates of all of the Spacer worlds  While departing Melpomenia  they notice a carbon dioxide feeding moss has begun feeding off insignificant leakages in their space suits  Barely recognizing this before stepping on their fully pressurized ship &mdash; which would have likely been disastrous &mdash; they set their blasters to minimum power to fry it off  and then set the ship to heavy UV illumination before stepping on board  This disinfection procedure kills any trace of the moss  preventing it from spreading to other worlds  As well as giving them another 47 Spacer worlds that they could visit  they now have a vital clue to where Earth may be found  Since the Spacer worlds were settled from Earth  they form a rough sphere with Earth at the centre  Two stars seem to match  One is a binary star  and also on the charts as an inhabited world  though with a question mark where its status should be indicated  The other is uncharted and much more likely to be Earth star  especially since legends do not mention Earth being part of a binary system  They decide however to go first to the binary system  because it may give them clues about what to expect on Earth itself  They next journey to the enigmatic charted system  which turns out to be Alpha Centauri  They find a remnant of the inhabitants of Earth  who many millennia ago were resettled there  There is a reference back to the events of Asimov novel Pebble in the Sky: we learn that the restoration of Earth soil was indeed attempted but was abandoned  Later  with Earth becoming uninhabitable  there was a grand project to terraform 'Alpha'  This too was not completed; the only dry land is an island 250 kilometers long and 65 kilometers wide  It is left open whether or not the entire population of the dying Earth was sent to Alpha  The natives  who call their home New Earth  are quite friendly  and Bliss  Trevize  Pelorat  and Fallom decide to enjoy some rest and relaxation  It turns out that the natives secretly intend to kill them  so as to prevent them from ever informing the rest of the galaxy of New Earth (the natives are paranoid of being taken by another Empire of any kind)  They are warned by a native woman  who becomes sympathetic upon hearing Fallom playing the flute with its transducer brain lobes  and make their escape in the middle of the night  Now certain that Alpha Centauri is not Earth but is near Earth  they head towards the uncharted system  They do notice and are puzzled by the very strong similarities between this star and the larger sun of the Alpha Centauri system  Asimov here is drawing attention to an astronomical curio: the nearest star system to Sol contains a star that has the same spectral type  G2 V  though Alpha Centauri A is a little larger and brighter  Entering the solar system of the uncharted star  they notice that it fits legends about Earth solar system  The sixth planet has very prominent rings  much more so than any known gas giant  Also the third planet  the one fit for life  possesses an abnormally large moon for any planet other than a gas giant  Obviously this is Earth and its solar system  On the approach to Earth  they detect that it is highly radioactive  and not capable of supporting life  but  while trying to use the ship computer to locate Solaria  Fallom calls Trevize attention upon the moon  which is big enough to serve as a hideout for the forces that lived on Earth  They land on there and find R  Daneel Olivaw  who explains that he has been paternalistically manipulating humanity for many millennia  and indeed  since Elijah Baley time  which was long before the Galactic Empire or Foundation  He caused the settlement of Alpha Centauri  the creation of Gaia  and the creation of psychohistory (detailed in Prelude to Foundation and Forward the Foundation)  He also manipulated Trevize into making his decision at the end of Foundation Edge (although he did not manipulate the decision itself)  Trevize confirms that decision  as the numerous narrow escapes have convinced him that the creation of Galaxia is the correct choice  Also  Daneel positronic brain is deteriorating  He explains that he is unable to design a new brain  as it would require extreme miniaturization  to the point where the brain would deteriorate immediately  Thus  he tells his visitors that he wishes to merge Fallom brain with his own  as Fallom life span is the exceptionally long one of a Spacer  This will buy him time to oversee Galaxia creation  Daneel continues to explain that since the dawn of civilization  man has been divided  This was the reason for his causing the creation of Psychohistory and Gaia  Another reason this was important was because of the likelihood of advanced life beyond the galaxy eventually attacking humanity  This danger is part of the conclusion to Asimov book The End of Eternity  in which Project Eternity (which manipulated human history to maintain human comfort) had to be destroyed to undo that same extraterrestrial disaster  &mdash; extraterrestrials giving humanity no hope of expansion  at which point the birth rate fell  and humanity became extinct ,1,0,0,0,0
354,Time Enough for Love,The book covers several periods from the life of Lazarus Long (birth name: Woodrow Wilson Smith)  the oldest living human  now more than two thousand years old  The first half of the book takes the form of several novellas connected by Lazarus retrospective narrative  In the framing story  Lazarus has decided that life is no longer worth living  but (in what is described as a reverse Arabian Nights scenario) will consent not to end his life as long as his companions will listen to his stories  This story concerns a 20th century United States Navy cadet who rises in the ranks while avoiding any semblance of real work by applying himself wholeheartedly to the principle of constructive laziness  After the Naval Academy  the protagonist becomes rich by taking advantage of the Agricultural Adjustment Act  which paid farmers not to farm their land  Lazarus tells of his visit as an interplanetary cargo trader to a planet with a culture like that of the medieval Middle East (reminiscent of Citizen of the Galaxy)  whereon he bought a pair of slaves  brother and sister  and immediately manumitted them  Because neither has any knowledge of independence  nor any education  Lazarus teaches them during the voyage how to be human  The two are the result of an experiment in genetic recombination in which two parent cells were separated into complementary haploid gametes  and recombined into two embryos  The resulting zygotes were implanted in a woman and gestated by her  with the result that although both have the same mother and genetic parents  they are no more closely related genetically than any two people taken at random  They have been prevented from sexual relations by a chastity belt; but having confirmed that there is no risk of genetic disease in their offspring (described as the sole valid reason against incest)  Lazarus solemnizes their marriage and later establishes them as the owners and operators of a thriving business  At the end of the story  he reveals a belief that they are descendants of his own  A short scene setter written after the style of The Song of Hiawatha introduces a planet whereto Lazarus has led a group of colonists now living in a manner reminiscent of the American Old West  Lazarus  now working as a banker and shopkeeper and keeping his true age secret  saves a young girl named Dora from a burning building and becomes her guardian  When she grows up  he marries her  and the two become founders of a new settlement where Lazarus' long life is less likely to be noticed  They are successful and eventually build a thriving town  Because Dora is not a Howard Family member  she eventually dies of old age  leaving Lazarus to mourn her loss  At the beginning of this story  Lazarus has regained his enthusiasm for life  and the remainder of the book is told in a conventional linear manner  Accompanied by some of his descendants  Lazarus has now moved to a new planet and established a polyamorous family consisting of three men  three women  and a larger number of children  two of whom are female clones of Lazarus himself  In the concluding tale  Lazarus  in a quest to experience something new  attempts to travel backward in time to 1919 in order to experience it as an adult; but an error in calculation places Lazarus in 1916 on the eve of America involvement in World War I  An unintentional result is that Lazarus falls in love with his own mother  In order to retain her esteem and that of his grandfather  Lazarus enlists in the army  Eventually Lazarus and his mother  Maureen  consummate their mutual attraction before Lazarus leaves for France  While in France  he is mortally wounded in the trenches of the Western Front  but rescued by those with whom he appears in Boondock and returned to his own time  There are also two Intermission sections  each some six or eight pages long  taking the form of lists of provocative phrases and aphorisms not directly related to the main narrative  These were later published independently  with illustrations  as The Notebooks of Lazarus Long ,1,0,0,0,0

Arthur wants to escort Alice to the dance  and she lies to cover for the fact that she is not invited to the event  Mrs  Adams uses Alice distress to finally goad Virgil into setting up a glue factory (which she has long insisted would be the family ticket to success)  It is eventually revealed that the glue recipe was developed by Virgil and another man under the direction and in the employ of J A  Lamb  who over the years declined to take up its production despite repeated proddings from Virgil  Although initially reluctant to steal from Mr  Lamb  Virgil finally persuades himself that his improvements to the recipe over the years has made it virtually his  As Arthur continues his secret courtship of Alice (he never talks about her nor tells anyone where he spends his evenings)  Alice continues spinning a web of lies to preserve the image of herself and her family that she has invented  This becomes especially difficult when she and Arthur encounter Walter in a bad part of town  walking with a young woman who gives the appearance of being a prostitute  At home  Walter is confronted by his father  who demands that Walter quit Lamb to help in setting up the glue factory  Walter refuses to help his father without a $300 cash advance  which Virgil cannot afford  Virgil arranges to resign from Lamb employ without speaking to him face to face  as he fears the old man reaction  and puts the glue factory into operation  Meanwhile  Alice works frantically to convince Arthur that the things other people will say about her will not be true  and continues to press the point even when Arthur insists that no one has spoken about her behind her back  and that nothing anyone else could say would change his opinion of her  Mrs  Adams decides to arrange a dinner so that Arthur can meet the family  and sets about planning an elaborate meal and hiring servants for the day  so that Arthur will be impressed  Walter again demands cash from his father (the amount has now risen to $350) without explaining why he needs it  and is again rebuffed  While these events occur at the Adams house  Arthur finally overhears things about Alice  which strikes a chord  and her family  including the fact that Virgil Adams has stolen from J  A  Lamb in setting up a factory with Lamb secret recipe for glue  The dinner itself is a total disaster: the day is unbearably hot  the food far too heavy  the hired servants surly and difficult to manage  capped by Virgil unwittingly acting like his lower middle class self  not the well to do businessman his wife and daughter wish him to act  Arthur  still reeling from what he heard about the Adamses earlier in the day  is stiff and uneasy throughout the evening  and Alice feels increasingly uncomfortable  By the end of the night  it is apparent to her that he will not come courting again  and she bids him farewell  That night  word reaches the family that Walter has skipped town  leaving behind him a massive debt to his employer  J  A  Lamb  which will have to be paid to keep Walter out of jail  The following morning  Virgil arrives at work to see that Lamb is opening his own glue factory on such a huge scale that Adams will not be able to compete  and will never make enough money to either pay his son debts or pay off the family mortgage  Virgil confronts Lamb about this state of affairs  working himself into such a state that he collapses  and returns to the same sickbed at home where he began the book  Lamb takes pity on the man  and arranges to buy the Adams glue factory for a sufficient price to pay off Walter debts and the family mortgage  The Adams family takes in boarders to help keep the family afloat economically  and Alice heads downtown to Frincke Business College to train herself in employable skills so that she can support the family  She encounters Arthur Russell on the road  and is pleased that their conversation is both polite and brief‚Äîthere is no possibility of renewed romance between them  which she accepts peacefully ,0,1,0,0,0
363,Lost Horizon,The origin of the eleven numbered chapters of the novel is explained in a prologue and epilogue  whose narrator is a neurologist  This neurologist and a novelist friend  Rutherford  are given dinner at Tempelhof  Berlin  by their old school friend Wyland  a secretary at the British embassy  A chance remark by a passing airman brings up the topic of Hugh Conway  a British consul in Afghanistan  who disappeared under odd circumstances  Later in the evening  Rutherford reveals to the narrator that  after the disappearance  he discovered Conway in a French mission hospital in Chung Kiang (probably Chongqing)  China  suffering from amnesia  Conway recovered his memory and told Rutherford his story  then slipped away again  Rutherford wrote down Conway story; he gives the manuscript to the neurologist  and that manuscript becomes the heart of the novel  In May 1931  during the British Raj in India  the 80 white residents of Baskul are being evacuated to Peshawar  owing to a revolution  In the airplane of the Maharajah of Chandrapore are Conway  the British consul  age 37; Mallinson  his young vice consul; an American  Barnard; and a British missionary  Miss Brinklow  The plane is hijacked and flown instead over the mountains to Tibet  After a crash landing  the pilot dies  but not before telling the four (in Chinese  which Conway knows) to seek shelter at the nearby lamasery of Shangri La  The location is unclear  but Conway believes the plane has progressed far beyond the western range of the Himalayas towards the less known heights of the Kuen Lun (i e  Kunlun)  The four are taken there by a party directed by Chang  a postulant at the lamasery who speaks English  The lamasery has modern conveniences  like central heating; bathtubs from Akron  Ohio; a large library; a grand piano; a harpsichord; and food from the fertile valley below  Towering above is Karakal  literally translated Blue Moon  a mountain more than high  Mallinson is keen to hire porters and leave  but Chang politely puts him off  The others eventually decide they are content to stay: Miss Brinklow  to teach the people a sense of sin; Barnard  because he is really Chalmers Bryant (wanted by the police for stock fraud) and because he is keen to develop the gold mines in the valley; Conway  because the contemplative scholarly life suits him  A seemingly young Manchu woman  Lo Tsen  is another postulant at the lamasery; she does not speak English but plays the harpsichord  Mallinson falls in love with her  as does Conway  though more languidly  Conway is given an audience with the High Lama  an unheard of honor  He learns that the lamasery was constructed in its present form by a Catholic monk named Perrault from Luxembourg  in the early eighteenth century  The lamasery has since then been joined by others who have found their way into the valley  Once they have done so  their aging slows; if they then leave the valley  they age quickly and die  Conway guesses correctly that the High Lama is Perrault  now 300 years old  In a later audience  the High Lama reveals that he is finally dying  and that he wants Conway to lead the lamasery  Meanwhile  Mallinson has arranged to leave the valley with porters and Lo Tsen  They are waiting for him outside the valley  and he cannot traverse the dangerous route by himself  so he convinces Conway to go along  This ends Rutherford manuscript  The last time Rutherford saw Conway  it appeared he was preparing to make his way back to Shangri La  Rutherford completes his account by telling the neurologist that he attempted to track Conway and verify some of his claims of Shangri La  He found the Chung Kiang doctor who had treated Conway  The doctor said Conway had been brought in by a Chinese woman who was ill and died soon after  She was old  the doctor had told Rutherford  Most old of anyone I have ever seen  implying that it was Lo Tsen  aged drastically by her departure from Shangri La ,0,1,0,0,0
364,Ishmael,Ishmael begins with a newspaper ad: Teacher seeks pupil  Must have an earnest desire to save the world  Apply in person  The nameless narrator and protagonist begins his story  telling how he first reacted to this ad with scorn because of the absurdity of wanting to save the world  a notion he feels that once he foolishly embraced himself as an adolescent during the counterculture movement of the 1960s  However  he responds to the ad anyway and  upon arriving at the address  finds himself in a room with a gorilla  He notices a polysemous sign that reads With man gone  will there be hope for gorilla  To the narrator surprise  he finds that the gorilla  calling himself Ishmael  can communicate telepathically  At first baffled by this  the man learns the story of how the gorilla came to be here and soon accepts Ishmael as his teacher  regularly returning to Ishmael office throughout the plot  The novel continues from this point mainly as a Socratic dialogue between Ishmael and his new student as they hash out what Ishmael refers to as how things came to be this way for mankind  Ishmael life  which began in the African wilderness  was spent mostly in a zoo and a menagerie  and since had been spent in the gazebo of a man that extricated him from physical captivity  He tells his student that it was at the menagerie that he learned about human language and culture and began to think about things that he never would have pondered in the wild  Subsequently  Ishmael tells his student that the subject for this learning experience will be captivity  primarily the captivity of man under a distorted civilizational system  The narrator claims to Ishmael that he has a vague notion of living in some sort of cultural captivity and being lied to in some way but he can not explain his feelings  Before proceeding Ishmael lays some ground definitions for his student  He defines: * Takers as people often referred to as civilized  Particularly  the culture born in an Agricultural Revolution that began about 10 000 years ago in the Near East; this is the culture of Ishmael pupil and  presumably  the reader  * Leavers as people of all other cultures; often derogatorily referred to by Takers as primitive  * A story as an interrelation between the gods  man  and the earth  with a beginning  middle  and end  * To enact is to strive to make a story come true  * A culture is a people who are enacting a story  Ishmael proceeds to tease from his pupil the premises of the story (i e  myth) being enacted by the Takers: that they are the pinnacle of evolution  that the world was made for man  and that man is here to conquer and rule the world  This rule is meant to bring about a paradise  as man increases his mastery of the world  however  he is always failing because he is flawed  Man does not know how to live and never will because that knowledge is unobtainable  So  however hard he labors to save the world  he is just going to go on defiling and spoiling it  Ishmael points out to his student that when the Takers decided there is something fundamentally wrong with humans  they took as evidence only their own culture history  They were looking at a half of one percent of the evidence taken from a single culture   Not a reasonable sample on which to base such a sweeping conclusion  Ishmael says: There is nothing fundamentally wrong with people  Given a story to enact that puts them in accord with the world  they will live in accord with the world  But given a story to enact that puts them at odds with the world  as yours does  they will live at odds with the world  Given a story to enact in which they are the lords of the world  they will act as the lords of the world  And  given a story to enact in which the world is a foe to be conquered  they will conquer it like a foe  and one day  inevitably  their foe will lie bleeding to death at their feet  as the world is now  Ishmael goes on to help his student discover that  contrary to what the Takers think  there are immutable laws that life is subject to and it is possible to discern them by studying the biological community  Together  Ishmael and his student identify one set of survival strategies which appear to be evolutionarily stable for all species (later dubbed the &#34;Law of Limited Competition&#34;): In short  &#34;you may compete to the full extent of your capabilities  but you may not hunt down competitors or destroy their food or deny them access to food  In other words  you may compete but you may not wage war &#34; All species inevitably follow this law  or as a consequence go extinct  The Takers believe themselves to be exempt from this Law and flout it at every point  Ishmael explains how the Takers rendered themselves above the laws governing life  using the story of The Fall of Man as an example  His version of why the fruit was forbidden to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden is: eating the fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil provides the gods with the knowledge of who shall live and who shall die‚Äîknowledge which they need to rule the world  The fruit nourishes only the gods  though  If Adam (&#34;man&#34;) were to eat from this tree  he might think that he gained the gods&#39; wisdom (without this actually happening) and consequently destroy the world and himself through his arrogance  &#34;And so they said to him  you may eat of every tree in the garden  save the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil  for on the day you eat of that tree  you will certainly die &#34; Ishmael makes the point that this story of the Fall of Man  which the Takers have adopted as their own  was in fact developed by Leavers to explain the origin of the Takers  If it were of Taker origin  the story would be of liberating ascent instead of a sinful fall  Ishmael and his student go on to discuss how  for the ancient Semitic herders among whom the tale originated  the story of Cain killing Abel symbolizes the Leaver being killed off and their lands taken so that it could be put under cultivation  These ancient herders realized that the Takers were acting as if they were gods themselves  with all the wisdom of what is good and evil and how to rule the world  And as a result the gods banished these people from the Garden and they were brought from a life of bounty in the hands of the gods to one of being the accursed tillers of the soil  To begin discerning the Leavers&#39; story  Ishmael proposes to his student a hypothesis: the Takers&#39; Agricultural Revolution was a revolution against the Leavers&#39; story  The Leavers take what they need from the world and leave the rest alone  Living in this manner (&#34;in the hands of the gods&#34;)  Leavers thrive in times of abundance and dwindle in times of scarcity  The Takers however  practicing their unique form of agriculture (dubbed by Quinn  Totalitarian agriculture) produce enormous food surpluses  which allows them to thwart the gods when they decide it&#39;s the Takers&#39; time to go hungry  &#34;When you have more food than you need  then the gods have no power over you &#34; Thus  Ishmael points out that the Takers revolution was not just a technological change  but also serves a mythological function  So we have a new pair of names for you: The Takers are 'those who know good and evil' and the Leavers are 'those who live in the hands of the gods'  Ishmael goes on to point out that by living in the hands of the gods  man is subject to the conditions under which evolution takes place  Australopithecus became Homo by living in the hands of the gods‚ÄîMan became man by living in the hands of the gods   &#34;by living the way the bushmen of Africa live; by living the way the Krenakarore of Brazil live    Not the way the Chicagoans live  not the way Londoners live &#34; &#34;In the hands of the gods is where evolution happens &#34; According to the Takers&#39; story  creation came to an end with man  &#34;In order to make their story come true  the Takers have to put an end to creation itself   and they&#39;re doing a damn good job of it!&#34; Ishmael brings together his synopsis on human culture by examining the story enacted by Leaver cultures  which provides a model of how to live‚Äîan alternative story for the Takers to enact  The premise of the Takers' story is 'The world belongs to man '    The premise of the Leavers' story is 'Man belongs to the world ' For three million years  man belonged to the world and because he belonged to the world  he grew and developed and became brighter and more dexterous until one day  he was so bright and so dexterous that we had to call him Homo sapiens sapiens   which means he was us  The Leavers' story is 'the gods made man for the world  the same way they made salmon and sparrows for the world  This seems to have worked well so far so we can take it easy and leave the running of the world to the gods'  Ishmael emphasizes that &#34;not in any sense is the Takers story &#39;chapter two&#39; of the story which was being enacted here during the first three million years of human life  The Leavers&#39; story has its own &#39;chapter two&#39; &#34; In evolution  observes Ishmael&#39;s student  there seems to be a tendency toward complexity  and towards self awareness and intelligence  Perhaps the gods intend the world to be filled with intelligent  self aware creatures and man&#39;s destiny following the Leavers&#39; story is &#34;to be the first  without being the last&#34;; to learn and then to be a role model and teacher for all those capable of becoming what he&#39;s become  Ishmael finishes with a summary of what his student can do if he earnestly desires to save the world: The story of Genesis must be undone  First  Cain must stop murdering Abel  This is essential if you are to survive  The Leavers are the endangered species most critical to the world   not because they are humans but because they alone can show the destroyers of the world that there is more than one right way to live  And then  of course  you must spit out the fruit of the forbidden tree  You must absolutely and forever relinquish the idea that you know who should live and who should die on this planet  Teach a hundred what I've taught you  and inspire each of them to teach a hundred  The student loses track of Ishmael&#39;s whereabouts and in his search for the gorilla ultimately discovers that he was secretly falling ill and has since died of pneumonia  When the student goes back to Ishmael&#39;s office  he finds the sign that he saw before (&#34;With man gone  will there be hope for gorilla &#34;) has a backside  The back contains another message: &#34;With gorilla gone  will there be hope for man &#34;,0,1,0,0,0
365,Childhood End,The novel is divided into three parts  following a third person omniscient narrative with no main character  In the late 20th century  the United States and the Soviet Union are competing to launch the first spaceship into orbit  to military ends  However  when vast alien spaceships suddenly position themselves above Earth principal cities  the space race is halted forever  After one week  the aliens announce they are assuming supervision of international affairs to prevent humanity extinction  As the Overlords  they bring peace  and they claim that interference will be limited  They interfere only twice with human affairs: in South Africa  where sometime before their arrival Apartheid had collapsed and was replaced with savage persecution of the white minority; and in Spain  where they put an end to bull fighting  Some humans are suspicious of the Overlords' benign intent  as they never appear in physical form  Overlord Karellen  the Supervisor for Earth  speaks directly only to Rikki Stormgren  the Finnish UN Secretary General  Karellen tells Stormgren that the Overlords will reveal themselves in 50 years  when humanity will have become used to their presence  Stormgren smuggles a device onto Karellen ship in an attempt to see Karellen true form  He succeeds  is shocked and chooses to keep silent  Humankind enters a golden age of prosperity at the expense of creativity  As promised  five decades after their arrival the Overlords appear for the first time; they resemble the traditional human folk images of demons‚Äîlarge bipeds with leathery wings  horns and tails  The Overlords are interested in psychic research  which humans suppose is part of their anthropological study  Rupert Boyce  a prolific book collector on the subject  allows one Overlord  Rashaverak  to study these books at his home  To impress his friends with Rashaverak presence  Boyce holds a party  during which he makes use of a Ouija board  An astrophysicist  Jan Rodricks  asks the identity of the Overlords' home star  George Greggson wife Jean faints as the Ouija board reveals a star catalog number confirming the direction in which Overlord supply ships appear and disappear  Jan Rodricks stows away on an Overlord supply ship and travels 40 light years to their home planet  Due to the time dilation of special relativity at near light speeds  the elapsed time on the ship is only a few weeks  and he arranges to endure it in drug induced suspended animation  Although humanity and the Overlords have peaceful relations  some believe human innovation is being suppressed and that culture is becoming stagnant  These groups establish New Athens  an island colony devoted to the creative arts  which George and Jean Greggson join  The Overlords conceal a special interest in the Greggsons' children  Jeffrey and Jennifer Anne  and intervene to save Jeffrey life when a tsunami strikes the island  The Overlords have been watching them since the incident with the Ouija board  which revealed the seed of the coming transformation hidden within Jean  Sixty years after the Overlords' arrival  human children  including the Greggsons'  begin to display telekinetic powers  Karellen reveals the Overlords' purpose; they serve the Overmind  a vast cosmic intelligence  born of amalgamated ancient civilizations  and freed from the limitations of material existence  Yet the Overlords themselves are strangely unable to join the Overmind  but serve it as a bridge species  charged with fostering other races' eventual merger with it  Because of this  Karellen expresses his envy of humanity  For the transformed children safety  they are segregated on a continent of their own  No more human children are born  and many parents find their lives stripped of meaning  and die or commit suicide  New Athens is destroyed by its members with a nuclear bomb  Jan Rodricks emerges from hibernation on the Overlord supply ship and arrives on their planet  The Overlords permit him a glimpse of how the Overmind communicates with them  When Jan returns to Earth approximately 80 years later by Earth time  he finds an unexpectedly altered planet  Humanity has effectively become extinct  and he is now the last man alive  Hundreds of millions of children ‚Äì no longer fitting with what Rodricks defines as human ‚Äì remain on the quarantined continent  Barely moving  with eyes closed and communicating by telepathy  they are the penultimate form of human evolution  having become a single group mind readying themselves to join the Overmind  Some Overlords remain on Earth to study the children from a safe distance  When the evolved children mentally alter the Moon rotation and make other planetary manipulations  it becomes too dangerous to remain  The departing Overlords offer to take Rodricks with them  but he chooses to stay to witness Earth end  and transmits a report of what he sees  The Overlords are eager to escape from their own evolutionary dead end by studying the Overmind  so Rodricks' information is potentially of great value to them  By radio  Rodricks describes a vast burning column ascending from the planet  As the column disappears  Rodricks experiences a profound sense of emptiness when the Overlords have gone  Then material objects and the Earth itself begin to dissolve into transparency  Jan reports no fear  but a powerful sense of fulfillment  The Earth evaporates in a flash of light  Karellen looks back at the receding Solar System and gives a final salute to the human species ,1,0,0,0,0

and then are horrified to see the banner of the King upon the ships  Aragorn has succeeded in using the Oathbreakers to defeat the Corsairs of Umbar; the men of Gondor who were once slaves on the ships are brought back to fight the host of Mordor  In the following Battle of the Pelennor Fields the Witch king is slain by Dernhelm  revealed to be √âowyn the niece of King Th√©oden  with help from Merry  Thus the siege is broken  but at heavy cost: many warriors of Gondor and Rohan fall  among them King Th√©oden  Denethor attempts to immolate himself and Faramir on his funeral pyre  but Gandalf and Pippin succeed in saving Faramir  who is subsequently healed by Aragorn  Aragorn also heals Merry and √âowyn  who were hurt by the Witch king before he fell  Knowing that it is only a matter of time before Sauron rebuilds his forces for another attack  Gandalf and Aragorn decide to draw out the hosts of Mordor with an assault on the Black Gate  providing a distraction so that Frodo and Sam may have a chance of reaching Mount Doom and destroy the One Ring  unseen by the Eye of Sauron  Gandalf and Aragorn lead an army to the Black Gate of Mordor and lay siege to Sauron army  The battle begins and the body of a troll he had killed falls onto Pippin  and he loses consciousness just as the Great Eagles arrive  Sam  who now bears the One Ring in Frodo place  rescues his master from torture and death by Orcs in the Tower of Cirith Ungol  Frodo and Sam navigate the barren wasteland of Mordor and are overtaken by a company of Orcs but escape and are forced to disguise themselves in Orcish armour  Gandalf plan to distract Sauron from the Ring is successful: Mordor is almost empty as all the remaining Orcs have been summoned to defend the land against the assault of the army led by Gandalf and Aragorn  Frodo and Sam  after a weary and dangerous journey  finally reach their final destination of the Crack of Doom  As Frodo is preparing to throw the Ring into Mount Doom  he succumbs to the Ring power and unknowingly claims it as his own  Just then  Gollum  who had been following Frodo and Sam still  attacks Frodo and bites off his finger and the Ring  Gollum gloats over getting his precious back  but loses his balance and falls into his death  taking the Ring with him  The Ring is finally destroyed  freeing Middle earth from Sauron power  Mount Doom erupts violently  trapping Frodo and Sam among the lava flows until the Great Eagles rescue them  Upon Sauron defeat  his armies at the Gate flee  Sauron finally appears as a gigantic shadow trying to reach out for the armies of men  but is now powerless and is blown away by a wind  The men under Sauron command that surrender are forgiven and allowed to return to their lands in peace  Aragorn is crowned King of Gondor outside the walls of Minas Tirith in a celebration during which all four Hobbits are greatly honoured for their contribution to the War of the Ring  A healed Faramir is appointed Prince of Ithilien and Steward of Gondor  and Aragorn marries Arwen  daughter of Elrond of Rivendell  After a series of goodbyes  the Hobbits finally return home  only to find the Shire in ruins  its inhabitants oppressed by Lotho Sackville Baggins (usually called The Chief or The Boss) who is in reality controlled by a shadowy figure called Sharkey  Sharkey has taken complete control of the Shire using corrupt Men  and begins felling trees in a gratuitous program of industrialization (which actually produces nothing except destruction and misery for the locals)  Merry  Pippin  Frodo and Sam make plans to set things right once more  They lead an uprising of Hobbits and are victorious at the Battle of Bywater which effectively frees the Shire  At the very doorstep of Bag End  they meet Sharkey  who is revealed to be the evil wizard Saruman  and his servant Gr√≠ma  Obstinate in defeat  Saruman abuses Gr√≠ma  who responds by slitting his master throat  Gr√≠ma is himself slain by hobbit archers as he attempts to escape  Over time  the Shire is healed  The many trees that Saruman men cut down are replanted;

368,The Drawing of the Three,The book begins less than seven hours after the end of The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger after The Man in Black has described The Gunslinger fate using tarot cards  Roland wakes up on a beach  where he is suddenly attacked by a strange  lobster like creature  which he dubs a lobstrosity  He kills the creature but not before losing the index and middle finger of his right hand  and most of his right big toe; his untreated wounds soon become infected  Feverish and losing strength  Roland continues to trek north along the beach  where he eventually encounters three doors  Each door opens onto New York City at different periods in time (1987  1964 and 1977  respectively) and  as Roland passes through these doors  he brings back the companions who will join him on his quest to the Dark Tower  The first door (labeled The Prisoner) brings Eddie Dean  a heroin addict who is in the process of smuggling cocaine for the drug lord Enrico Balazar  Since Eddie was headed deeper into addiction (at the hands of his brother Henry) or prison (at the hands of the government)  or worse (at the hands of his drug lord)  he decides to throw his lot in with Roland  although with deep misgivings that he occasionally gives vent to in the form of angry outbursts  The second door (labeled The Lady of Shadows  so called for her multiple personalities and metaphorically  multiple shadows) reveals Odetta Holmes  a black woman who is active in the civil rights movement  She is wealthy and missing her legs below the knees after being pushed in front of a subway car  Odetta is completely unaware that she has an alternate personality  a violent  predatory woman named Detta  Roland and Eddie are forced to contend with both of these personalities when Odetta body is forcibly abducted into their world  Instead of revealing a new companion  the third door (labeled The Pusher) instead reveals a new adversary for Roland: Jack Mort  a sociopath who takes sadistic pleasure in injuring and killing random strangers &mdash; and the man responsible for the head trauma that created Odetta Holmes alternate personality  the loss of Odetta/Detta legs  and the death of Jake Chambers  Mort murder of Jake led to Jake appearance in The Gunslinger  Roland decisions while dealing with Mort are crucial to later events in the series  The encounter results in the death of Jack Mort and the fusing of the personalities of Odetta and Detta to form a third woman  who will thenceforth be called Susannah  Although the Gunslinger does not bring The Pusher with him into his own world (as might be guessed based upon what has happened regarding the previous two doors)  his quest for the Dark Tower is not lost  because Roland does draw his third  His third is Susannah; the result of Odetta and Detta fusion of minds  Through his actions both in his world  and in Eddie  Susannah  and Jack Mort world  Roland saves Eddie and Susannah  He saves Eddie by curing him of his addiction and bringing Susannah  whom Eddie loves  He saves Susannah by helping her fuse her former personalities  Odetta Holmes and Detta Walker  into a stronger single personality  Susannah Dean  Both owe their lives to Roland  and Roland is acutely aware that he may need to sacrifice them to reach the Tower  Each of these people is essential for Roland to continue his quest  They are all part of a ka tet  defined as one made from many and sharing the same destiny ,1,0,0,0,0
369,The Gunslinger, It tells the story of the gunslinger  Roland of Gilead  and his quest to catch the man in black  the first of many steps towards his ultimate destination   the Dark Tower  The main story takes place in a world that is somewhat similar to the Old West but exists in an alternate time frame or parallel universe to ours  Roland exists in a place where the world has moved on  This world has a few things in common with our own  however  including memories of the song Hey Jude and the child rhyme that begins Beans  Beans  the Musical Fruit  Vestiges of forgotten or skewed versions of real world technology also appear  such as a reference to a gas pump that is worshipped as a god named Amoco  and an abandoned way station with a water pump which is powered by an atomic slug  As Roland travels across the desert with his mule in search of the man in black  he encounters Brown  a farmer  and Zoltan  his crow  who graciously offers to put him up for the night  While he is there  we learn of his time spent in Tull through a flashback  Tull was a small town which Roland came to not too long before the start of the novel  The man in black had passed through the town previously; he brought a dead man back to life  and left a trap for Roland: the town itself  After Roland spends some time there  the leader of the local church reveals to him that the man in black has impregnated her  and has turned her against Roland  She turns the entire town on Roland; men  women  and children  In order to escape with his life  Roland is forced to kill every resident of the town  including his lover  Allie  Telling this story seems cathartic for Roland  When he awakes the next day  his mule is dead  forcing him to proceed on foot  Before Roland leaves  Brown asks his permission to eat the mule  At the way station Roland first encounters Jake Chambers  who died in his own universe (presumably our own) when he was pushed in front of a car while walking to school in Manhattan  Roland is nearly dead when he makes it to the way station  and Jake brings him water and jerky while he is recovering  Jake does not know how long he has been at the way station  nor does he know exactly how he got there  He hid when the man in black passed by the way station  Roland hypnotizes him to determine the details of his death  but makes him forget before he awakes (since Jake death was extremely violent and painful)  Before they leave the way station they encounter a demon in the cellar while looking for food  After their palaver  Roland snatches the jawbone from the skeleton in the hole  from which the demon speaks  After leaving the way station  Jake and Roland eventually make their way out of the desert into more welcoming lands  Roland rescues Jake from an encounter with an oracle  and then couples with the oracle himself in order to learn more about his fate and path to the Dark Tower  Roland gives Jake the jawbone from the way station to focus on while he is gone  After Roland returns  Jake discards the jawbone  As Jake and Roland make their way closer to the mountain  Jake begins to fear what will become of him  In a flashback  we learn about Roland chance encounter in a kitchen which leads to the hanging of Hax  the cook  The apprentice gunslingers are allowed to witness the hanging with their fathers' permission  Roland reveals how he was tricked into calling out his teacher Cort early  through the treachery of Marten  He succeeded in defeating Cort in battle through his ingenious weapon selection   his hawk  David  Jake and Roland make their way into the twisting tunnels below the mountain  propelled along by an ancient mine cart  During the journey  they are attacked by the Slow Mutants  monstrous subterranean creatures  Roland fights the Slow Mutants off and they proceed  Eventually they find the Man in Black  and as Jake dangles precariously from the tracks  Roland comes to a pivotal choice; save Jake or pursue the Man in Black  Roland chooses to follow the Man in Black  Jake tells Roland  whilst hanging: Go then  there are other worlds than these  He lets go of the edge and falls without screaming  After sacrificing Jake in the mountain  Roland makes his way down to speak to the man in black  The man in black reads Roland fate from a pack of cards  including the sailor (Jake)  the prisoner (Eddie Dean) the lady of shadows (Odetta Holmes)  death (but not for Roland)  and the Tower itself  as the center of everything  The man in black states that he is merely a pawn of Roland true enemy  the one who now controls the Dark Tower itself  The man in black creates a representation of the universe  attempting to frighten Roland by showing him how truly insignificant he is in the grand scheme of things  and asks him to give up his quest  Roland refuses  and is made to fall asleep by the man in black  When he wakes up  ten years have passed and there is a skeleton next to him ‚Äî what he assumes to be the man in black  Roland then sits on the edge of the Western Sea  contemplating the three people he now is charged with bringing into All World   the Prisoner  the Lady of Shadows  and the Pusher ,1,0,0,0,0

374,The Long Walk,One hundred teenage boys participate in an annual walking contest called The Long Walk  which is the national sport  Each Walker must maintain a speed of at least four miles per hour; if he drops below that speed for 30 seconds  he receives a verbal warning (which can be erased by walking for one hour without being warned)  If a Walker with three warnings slows down again  he is ticketed  The meaning of this term is intentionally kept vague at first  but it soon becomes clear that buying a ticket means to be shot dead by soldiers riding in half tracks along the roadside  Walkers may be shot immediately for certain serious violations  such as trying to leave the road or attacking the half track  The soldiers use electronic equipment to precisely determine a Walker speed  The event is run by a character known as The Major  who is implied to have much power  stemming from a possible military or fascist state system  The Major appears at the beginning of the Walk to encourage the boys and start them on their way  and then occasionally thereafter  While the Walkers initially greet him with awe and respect  they eventually realize their admiration is misplaced and ridicule him in later appearances  The Walk begins at the Maine/Canada border and travels the east coast of the United States until the winner is determined  There are no stops  rest periods  or established finish line  and the Walk does not pause for any reason (including bad weather or darkness); it ends only when one Walker is left alive  According to the rules  the Walkers can obtain aid only from the soldiers  who distribute canteens of water and belts packed with food concentrates (apparently similar to the ones developed by NASA space program) just before the Walk begins  They may request a fresh canteen at any time  and new food supplies are distributed at 9:00 every morning  Walkers may bring anything they can carry  including food or additional footwear  but cannot receive aid from bystanders  They are allowed to have bodily contact with onlookers as long as they stay on the road  While they cannot physically interfere with one another to detrimental effect  they can help each other  provided they stay above four miles per hour  The winner receives The Prize: anything he wants for the rest of his life  It is implied that many past winners have died soon after the Walk  due to its hazardous mental and physical challenges  The Long Walk is not only a physical trial  but a psychological one  as the Walkers are continually pressed against the idea of death and their mortality  Contestants have actually tried to crawl at 4&nbsp;mph to survive after their legs gave out  The story has several characters who suffer mental breakdown  one of whom kills himself by tearing out his throat  and most characters experience some mental degeneration from the stress and lack of sleep  The protagonist of the novel is Raymond Davis Garraty  a 16 year old boy from the town of Pownal in Androscoggin County  Maine  Early on  Ray falls in with several other boys‚Äîincluding Peter McVries  Arthur Baker  Hank Olson  Collie Parker  Pearson  Harkness  and Abraham‚Äîwho refer to themselves as The Musketeers  Another Walker‚ÄîGary Barkovitch‚Äîquickly establishes himself as an external antagonist  as he quickly angers his fellow walkers with multiple taunts of dancing on their graves  This results in the death of a fellow walker  Rank  who is ticketed while trying to injure Barkovitch  Lastly  the most alluring and mysterious Walker is a boy named Stebbins  Throughout the Walk  Stebbins establishes himself as a loner  observing the ground beneath him as he listens to fellow Walkers' complaints  seemingly unaffected by the mental and physical strains  The only character Stebbins truly interacts with is Ray Garraty  In one conversation  Garraty alludes to Alice in Wonderland  likening Stebbins to the Caterpillar  Stebbins  however  corrects him: he believes himself to be more of a White Rabbit type  Along the road  the Walkers learn that one of their number  a kid named Scramm ‚Äî who is initially the heavy odds on favorite to win the Walk ‚Äî is married  When Scramm gets pneumonia  the remaining Walkers agree that the winner will use some of the Prize to take care of his pregnant widow  Cathy  Members of the public interfering with the Walkers can receive an interference ticket  This nearly occurs when the mother of a Walker named Percy tries  on several occasions  to get onto the road and find her son (at her last attempt  he has already been killed for attempting to sneak away)  Only the intervention of the local police keeps her from being executed  The second instance is when a spectator dog runs across the road in front of the Walkers and is shot  However  one man is able to throw the Walkers watermelon slices before being hauled away by the police rather than the soldiers; several Walkers receive third warnings after taking the watermelon  but none of them are shot  Garraty becomes closest to Peter McVries  a boy with a prominent facial scar who speculates that his own reason for joining the Walk is a subconscious death wish  When Garraty suffers a charley horse and comes within two seconds of being killed  McVries keeps him talking and distracted long enough to drop a warning  saving his life  After five days and hundreds of miles  the Walk eventually comes down to Garraty and Stebbins  who revealed to Garraty and McVries earlier that day  that he is the illegitimate son of the Major  Stebbins states he used to think the Major was unaware of his existence  but it turns out that the Major has numerous illegitimate children nationwide  Four years earlier the Major took Stebbins to the finish of a Long Walk and now Stebbins feels that the Major has set him up to be the rabbit  motivating other runners to walk farther to prolong the race  just as rabbits are used in dog races  Stebbins plan  upon winning the Walk  is to ask that his prize be to be taken into [his] father house  At the end of the book  having gone farther than any Long Walk in history   the Long Walkers reached Massachusetts for the first time in seventeen years   Garraty decides to give up after realizing that Stebbins has shown almost no weaknesses over the duration of the Walk  Garraty catches up with Stebbins to tell him this  but before he can speak Stebbins collapses and dies; thus Garraty is declared the winner  Unaware of the celebration going on around him  Garraty gets up from Stebbins side and keeps on walking  believing the race to still continue  as he hallucinates of a dark figure not far ahead that he thinks is another runner  He ignores a jeep coming towards him in which the Major comes to award him the victory  thinking it is a trespassing vehicle  When a hand  likely the Major  tries to hold his shoulder Garraty somehow finds the strength to run ,1,0,0,0,0
375,Solaris, Solaris chronicles the ultimate futility of attempted communications with the extraterrestrial life on a far distant planet  Solaris  with whom Terran scientists are attempting communication  is almost completely covered with an ocean that is revealed to be a single  planet encompassing organism  What appear to be waves on its surface are later revealed to be the equivalents of muscle contractions  Kris Kelvin arrives aboard the scientific research station hovering (via anti gravity generators) near the oceanic surface of the planet Solaris  The scientists there have studied the planet and its ocean for many decades  a scientific discipline known as Solaristics  which over the years has degenerated to simply observe  record and categorize the complex phenomena that occur upon the surface of the ocean  Thus far  they have only achieved the formal classification of the phenomena with an elaborate nomenclature ‚Äî yet do not understand what such activities really mean in a strictly scientific sense  Shortly before psychologist Kelvin arrival  the crew has exposed the ocean to a more aggressive and unauthorized experimentation with a high energy X ray bombardment  Their experimentation gives unexpected results and becomes psychologically traumatic for them as individually flawed humans  The ocean response to their aggression exposes the deeper  hidden aspects of the personalities of the human scientists ‚Äî whilst revealing nothing of the ocean‚Äôs nature itself  To the extent that the ocean‚Äôs actions can be understood  the ocean then seems to test the minds of the scientists by confronting them with their most painful and repressed thoughts and memories  It does this via the materialization of physical human simulacra; Kelvin confronts memories of his dead lover and guilt about her suicide  The torments of the other researchers are only alluded to but seem even worse than Kelvin‚Äôs personal purgatory  The ocean‚Äôs intelligence expresses physical phenomena in ways difficult for their limited earth science to explain  deeply upsetting the scientists  The alien (extraterrestrial) mind of Solaris is so greatly different from the human mind of (objective) consciousness that attempts at inter species communications are a dismal failure ,1,0,0,0,0

382,Excession,The Excession of the title is a perfect black body sphere that appears mysteriously on the edge of Culture space  appears to be older than the Universe itself and resists the attempts of the Culture and technologically equivalent societies (notably the Zetetic Elench) to probe it  The Excession is what the Culture social scientists describe as an Outside Context Problem  one which a society cannot foresee and is often fatal  A metaphor to help explain this phrase is that of a successful aboriginal culture suddenly finding ocean going vessels on its shores for the first time  A group of stereotypical bureaucrats tries to manage the Culture response to the Excession but is brushed aside by the Interesting Times Gang  an informal group of Minds some of whom are veterans of the Idiran Culture War  to try to deal with what is by far the most serious challenge the Culture has faced  Meanwhile a rapidly expanding race  which the Culture calls the Affront (because of its systematic sadism towards subject species and its own females and junior males  despite being relatively advanced)  tries to exploit the Excession by infiltrating a store of mothballed Culture warships and using them to claim control of the mysterious object  It turns out that the Affront have been manipulated into their grab for power by another Culture faction which thought it was morally imperative to curb the Affront cruelty by any means  and intend to use the Affront theft of Culture warships as an excuse for war  The GSV Sleeper Service eventually takes control of the situation  Its name is the most meaningful pun in the story: outwardly it is an Eccentric (drop out from the Culture) which dedicates its enormous resources to presenting tableaux of historical events (mainly battles) populated by passengers in suspended animation; but in fact it is a sleeping member of Special Circumstances  the Culture covert operations organization  The name of Sleeper Service is thus double pronged‚Äîit is a Sleeper Service to human beings in Storage  and a Sleeper Service within SC  as it has produced a massive war fleet during the 40 year period it has spent behaving as an Eccentric  It prepares to deploy this fleet during transit to the Excession  But Sleeper Service has an unresolved issue  Until a few decades previously  the ship operated under another name as a normal GSV  providing a habitat for a vast number of Culture citizens  Two of its passengers  Dajeil and Genar Hofoen  had had an intense love affair which ended badly when Genar Hofoen was unfaithful and a pregnant Dajeil tried to kill Genar Hofoen  but only succeeded in the feticide of the child with which Genar Hofoen was pregnant  After the break up  Dajeil froze her pregnancy and subsequently remained in a state of intense depression for 40 years  and the ship changed its name to Sleeper Service and started acting as an Eccentric  It carried only one conscious humanoid passenger  Dajeil  and spent much of its attention trying to talk her out of her depression  for which it considered itself partly responsible  As a result  when the Culture asks Sleeper Service to help in dealing with the threat of war  the ship demands that in return Genar Hofoen must be handed over to it  Genar Hofoen is lured to Sleeper Service on a pretext  and only later told that he is there to work with Dajeil to help her recover from her psychological trauma  Sleeper Service then unloads the passengers who had been part of its historical tableaux  Having spent much of its Eccentric decades converting a large percentage of the mass of the tableaux' scenery into engines  it easily outruns the very fast ship which other elements of the Culture had asked to keep watch on it  Once it is beyond the watching ship sensor range  Sleeper Service changes course and heads towards the Excession  When it arrives it becomes apparent it has previously converted the rest of its spare mass into a vast fleet of remote controlled warships numbering in the area of 80 000 units  The Excession  in response to the Sleeper charging at it  then triggers a multi light year Gridfire wave which threatens to obliterate it and its entire fleet  along with the accompanying Grey Area  Only its Mindstate  transmitted right at the Excession  saves it by convincing the Excession to halt its attack  The Minds controlling the ships which the Affront stole from the mothball find themselves outnumbered more than 130:1  and refuse to help the Affront  The Affront fleet commander and the Culture ship which led the conspiracy commit suicide  A prolonged war is thus averted  At the same time the Excession disappears as mysteriously as it arrived  Meanwhile  the rush of events  combined with a conversation with Genar Hofoen  results in Dajeil moving out of her depression and completing her pregnancy  Genar Hofoen returns to the Affront  having been rewarded by being physically transformed into a member of the Affront species (whose company he finds more stimulating than that of the Culture people)  The book epilogue reveals that the Excession is a sentient entity which is currently acting as a bridge for a procession of even higher beings which travel between universes  It also assesses whether the species and societies it encounters are suitable to be enlightened about some unknown further existence beyond the Universe  As a result of events in the story the Excession concludes that the civilisations it has encountered in our universe are not ready for this enlightenment and moves on so that it will not cause any further disturbance  hence its disappearance at the end of the book  It also takes the name given to it by the Culture ‚Äì Excession ‚Äì as its own  ==Outside Context Proble,1,0,0,0,0

384,Use of Weapons, The book is made up of two narrative streams  interwoven in alternating chapters  The numbers of the chapters indicate which stream they belong to: one stream is numbered forward in words (One  Two    )  while the other is numbered in reverse with Roman numerals (XIII  XII    )  The story told by the former moves forward chronologically (as the numbers suggest) and tells a self contained story  while in the latter is written in reverse chronology with each chapter successively earlier in Zakalwe life  Further complicating this structure is a prologue and epilogue set shortly after the events of the main narrative  and many flashbacks within the chapters  The forward moving stream of the novel deals with the attempts of Diziet Sma and a drone named Skaffen Amtiskaw to re enlist Zakalwe for another job  the task itself and the payment that Zakalwe wishes for it  The backward moving stream describes earlier jobs that Zakalwe has performed for the Culture  ultimately returning to his pre Culture career as a general on his homeworld  It transpires that the payment he requires from Sma relates to an incident from his earlier life ,1,0,0,0,0

Frightened by the talking log  the carpenter  Antonio or Master Cherry as he is called does not know what to do until his neighbor Geppetto  known for disliking children  drops by looking for a piece of wood to build a marionette  Seeing a perfect opportunity  Antonio gives the block to Geppetto  Geppetto is extremely poor and plans to make a living as a puppeteer  He carves the block into a boy and names him Pinocchio  As soon as Pinocchio nose has been carved  it begins to grow longer and longer before Geppetto is finished with him  After the puppet is finished  Geppetto teaches him to walk and Pinocchio runs out the door and away into the town  He is caught by a Carabiniere but when people say that Geppetto dislikes children  the carabineer assumes that Pinocchio has been mistreated and imprisons Geppetto  Pinocchio heads back to Geppetto house and encounters The Talking Cricket who has lived in the house for over a century  It tells him that boys who do not obey their parents grow up to be donkeys  Pinocchio throws a hammer at the cricket and accidentally kills it  Unable to find food in the house  Pinocchio ventures to a neighbor house to beg for food and the annoyed neighbor pours a basin of water on him  Pinocchio returns home freezing and tries to warm himself by placing his feet upon the stove  The next morning he wakes to find that his feet have burnt off  Geppetto  who has been released from jail and has three pears for a meal  makes his son a new pair of feet  In gratitude  Pinocchio promises to go to school  Since Geppetto has no money to buy school books  he sells his only coat  Pinocchio heads off to school  but on the way he is distracted by some music and crowds and he follows the sounds until he finds himself in a crowd of people  all congregated to see the Great Marionette Theater  Pinocchio sells his school books for tickets to the show  During the performance  the puppets Harlequin  Punch  and Signora Rosaura see Pinocchio and cry out  It is our brother Pinocchio! The audience grows angry  and the theater director  Mangiafuoco  comes out to see what is going on  Upset  he decides to use Pinocchio as firewood to cook his dinner  Pinocchio pleads to be saved and Mangiafuoco gives in  When he learns about Pinocchio poor father  he gives the marionette five gold pieces for Geppetto  As Pinocchio heads home to give the coins to his father  he meets a fox and a cat who convince him that if he plants his coins in the Field of Miracles  outside the city of Catchfools  then they will grow into a tree with a thousand gold coins  or perhaps two thousand  Pinocchio heads off on a journey to Catchfools with the Cat and Fox  On the way  they stop at the Inn of the Red Crayfish  where the Fox and Cat gorge themselves on food at Pinocchio expense  The fox and cat take off ahead of Pinocchio and disguise themselves as bandits while Pinocchio continues on toward Catchfools  The ghost of the Talking Cricket appears  telling him to go home and give the coins to his father but Pinocchio ignores him  As he passes through the forest  the disguised Cat and Fox jump out and try to rob Pinocchio  who hides the money in his mouth  In the struggle that follows Pinocchio bites the Cat hand off and escapes deeper into the forest where he sees a white house ahead  Stopping to knock on the door  he is greeted by a young Fairy with Turquoise Hair  who says she is dead and waiting to be taken  However  as he speaks to her  the bandits catch him and hang him in a tree  After a while the Fox and Cat get tired of waiting for the marionette to suffocate and leave  The Blue haired Fairy sends a falcon and a poodle to rescue Pinocchio  and she calls in three famous doctors to tell her if Pinocchio is dead  The first two (an owl and a crow) are uncertain  but the third‚Äîthe Talking Cricket that Pinocchio presumably killed earlier‚Äîknows that Pinocchio is fine and tells the marionette that he has been disobedient and hurt his father  The Blue haired Fairy tries to make Pinocchio take medicine  saying he will soon die if he does not  but he refuses to take it  despite promising to if he is given sugar  which the Blue haired Fairy gives him  However Four Black Rabbits then enter the room with a coffin and tell Pinocchio they have come to take him away  as he will be dead soon  Pinocchio takes the medicine and the rabbits leave  The Blue haired Fairy asks Pinocchio what happened and he tells her  She then asks him where the gold coins are  Pinocchio lies  saying he has lost them  As he utters this lie (and more) his nose begins to grow until it is so long he cannot turn around in the room  The Fairy explains to Pinocchio that it is his lies that are making his nose grow long  then calls in a flock of woodpeckers to chisel down his nose  Pinocchio and the Blue haired Fairy decide to become brother and sister  and the Fairy sends for Geppetto to come live with them in the forest  Pinocchio heads out to meet his father  but on the way he meets the fox and cat again (whom he had not recognized as the bandits  even though he has a hint from the cat bandaged front paw‚Äîwhich he had bitten earlier; the fox tells him the cat had shown mistaken kindness to a wolf)  They remind Pinocchio of the Field of Miracles  and finally he agrees to go with them and plant his gold  After half a day journey  they reach the city of Catchfools  Everyone in the town has done something exceedingly foolish and now suffers as a result  When they reach the Field of Miracles  Pinocchio buries his gold then runs off to wait the twenty minutes it will take for his gold to grow  After twenty minutes he returns  only to find no tree and‚Äîeven worse‚Äîno gold coins  Realizing what has happened from a bird  he goes to Catchfools and tells the judge  an old Gorilla  about the fox and cat  The judge (as is the custom in Catchfools) sends Pinocchio to prison for his foolishness for four months  While he is in prison  however  the emperor of Catchfools declares a celebration  and all prisoners are set free  As Pinocchio heads back to the forest  he finds an enormous serpent with a smoking tail blocking the way  After some confusion  he asks the serpent to move  but the serpent remains completely still  Concluding that it is dead  Pinocchio begins to step over it  but the serpent suddenly rises up and hisses at the marionette  toppling him over onto his head  Struck by Pinocchio fright and comical position  the snake laughs so hard  it bursts an artery and dies  While sneaking into a farmer yard to take some grapes  Pinocchio is caught in a weasel trap  He asks a bird to help him  but it refuses after hearing Pinocchio was planning to steal grapes  When the farmer comes out and finds Pinocchio  he ties him up in a doghouse to guard his chicken coop  That night  a group of weasels come and tell Pinocchio that they had made a deal with former watchdog Melampo to let them raid the chicken coop if he could have a chicken  Pinocchio says he wants two chickens  so the weasels agree and go into the henhouse  Pinocchio then locks the door and barks loudly  The farmer gets the weasels and frees Pinocchio as a reward  Pinocchio comes to where the cottage was and finds nothing but a gravestone  Believing the Blue haired Fairy died from sorrow  he weeps until a friendly pigeon offers to give him a ride to the seashore  where Geppetto is building a boat to go out and search for Pinocchio  They fly to the seashore and Pinocchio sees Geppetto out in a boat  The puppet leaps into the water and tries to swim to Geppetto  but the waves are too rough and Pinocchio is washed underwater as Geppetto is swallowed by a terrible shark  A kindly dolphin gives Pinocchio a ride to the nearest island  which is the Island of Busy Bees  Everyone is working and no one will give Pinocchio any food as long as he will not help them  He finally offers to carry a lady jug home in return for food and water  When they get to the house  Pinocchio recognizes the lady as the Blue haired Fairy  now miraculously old enough to be his mother  She says she will act as Pinocchio mother and Pinocchio will begin going to school  She hints that if Pinocchio does well in school he will become a real boy  Pinocchio starts school the next day and after showing his determination becomes a friend to all the schoolboys  A while later a group of boys trick Pinocchio into playing hookey by saying they saw a large whale at the beach  Hoping that it is the shark that swallowed Geppetto  he accompanies them to the beach only to find he has been fooled  He begins fighting with the boys and one boy grabs a schoolbook of Pinocchio and throws it at him  The marionette ducks and the book hits another boy named Eugene  who is knocked out  The other boys flee while Pinocchio tries to revive Eugene  Then two policemen come up and accuse Pinocchio of injuring Eugene  Before he can explain  the policemen grab him to take him to jail‚Äîbut he escapes and is chased into the sea by the police dog  The dog starts to drown and Pinocchio saves him  The dog is grateful and promises to be Pinocchio friend  Pinocchio happily starts swimming to shore  Then The Green Fisherman catches Pinocchio in his net and starts to eat the fish  saying Pinocchio must be a very special fish  Taking off the marionette clothes and covering him with flour  the ogre prepares to eat Pinocchio  The police dog then comes in and rescues Pinocchio from the ogre  On the way home  Pinocchio stops at a man house and asks about Eugene  The man says Eugene is fine  but that Pinocchio must be a truant  Pinocchio says that he is always truthful and obedient  Again his nose grows longer and Pinocchio immediately tells the truth about himself  causing the nose to shrink back to normal  Pinocchio gets home in the middle of the night  He knocks on the door and a snail opens the third story window  Pinocchio pleads to be let in and the snail says he will come down  Since a snail is slow  it takes all night for the snail to come down and let Pinocchio in  By the time the snail comes down Pinocchio has banged his foot against the door and gotten stuck  The snail brings Pinocchio artificial food and the marionette faints  When he wakes  he is on the couch and the Fairy says she will give him another chance  Pinocchio does excellently in school and passes with high honors  The Fairy promises that Pinocchio will be a real boy next day and says he should invite all his friends to a party  He goes to invite everyone  but he is sidetracked when he meets a boy named Romeo‚Äînicknamed Lampwick because he is so tall and skinny  Lampwick is about to go to a place called Toyland  where everyone plays all day and never works  Pinocchio goes along with him and they have a wonderful time in the land of Play‚Äîuntil one morning Pinocchio awakes with donkey ears  A Squirrel tells him that boys who do nothing but play and never work always grow into donkeys  Within a short while Pinocchio has become a donkey  He is sold to a circus and is trained to do all kinds of tricks  Then one night in the circus he falls and sprains his leg  The circus owner sells the donkey to a man who wants to skin him and make a drum  The man throws the donkey into the sea to drown him‚Äîand brings up a living wooden boy  Pinocchio explains that the fish ate all the donkey skin off of him and he is now a marionette again  Pinocchio dives back into the water and swims out to sea‚Äîwhen he is swallowed by The Terrible Shark  Inside the shark Pinocchio meets a tuna who is resigned to the fate and just says they will have to wait to be digested  Pinocchio sees a light from far off and he follows the light  At the other end is Geppetto  who had been living on a ship that was also in the shark  Pinocchio and Geppetto and the tuna manage to get out from inside the shark and Pinocchio heroically attempts to swim with Geppetto to shore  which turns out to be too far; however  the tuna rescues them and brings them to shore  Pinocchio and Geppetto try to find a place to stay  They pass two beggars  who are the Fox and the Cat  The Cat is  ironically  really blind now  and the fox is actually lame  tailless (having sold his tail for money) and mangy  They plead for food or money  but Pinocchio will give them nothing  They arrive at a small house  and living there is the Talking Cricket  who says they can stay  Pinocchio gets a job doing work for a farmer  whose donkey is dying  Pinocchio recognizes the donkey as Lampwick  Pinocchio mourns over Lampwick dead body and the farmer is perplexed as to why  Pinocchio says that Lampwick was his friend and they went to school together  causing Farmer John to be even more confused  After long months of working for the farmer and supporting the ailing Geppetto he goes to town with what money he has saved (40 pennies to be exact) to buy himself a new suit  He meets the snail  who tells him that the Blue haired Fairy is ill and needs money  Pinocchio instantly gives the snail all the money he has  promising that he will help his mother as much as he is helping his father  That night  he dreams he is visited by the Fairy  who kisses him  When he wakes up  he is a real boy at last  Furthermore  Pinocchio finds that the Fairy left him a new suit and boots  and a bag which Pinocchio thinks is the forty pennies he originally loaned to the Blue Fairy  The boy is shocked to find instead forty freshly minted gold coins  He is also reunited with Geppetto  now healthy and resuming woodcarving  They live happily ever after ,0,1,0,0,0

390,Feersum Endjinn, The book is set on a far future Earth where the uploading of mindstates into a world spanning computer network (known as the data corpus  cryptosphere or simply crypt) is commonplace  allowing the dead to be easily reincarnated (though by custom  only a limited number of reincarnations are allowed)  Humanity has lost much of its technological background  due partly to an exodus by much of the species  and partly to the fact that those who remained (or at least their rulers) are fighting against more advanced technology such as Artificial Intelligence  Meanwhile  the solar system is drifting into an interstellar molecular cloud (the Encroachment)  which will eventually dim the Sun light sufficiently to end life on Earth  The Diaspora (the long departed segment of humanity) have left behind a device (the Fearsome Engine of the title) to deal with the problem; the book follows four characters who become involved in the attempt to activate it  with the narrative moving between the four (who do not meet until very near the end) in rotation  A quarter of the book is told by Bascule the Teller and is written phonetically in the first person  This is explained by Bascule dyslexia  The fourth chapter of the book Part One opens with:,1,0,0,0,0

392,Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions, The story is about a two dimensional world referred to as Flatland which is occupied by geometric figures  Women are simple line segments  while men are regular polygons with various numbers of sides  The narrator is a humble square  a member of the social caste of gentlemen and professionals in a society of geometric figures  who guides us through some of the implications of life in two dimensions  The Square has a dream about a visit to a one dimensional world (Lineland) which is inhabited by lustrous points  He attempts to convince the realm ignorant monarch of a second dimension but finds that it is essentially impossible to make him see outside of his eternally straight line  He is then visited by a three dimensional sphere  which he cannot comprehend until he sees Spaceland for himself  This Sphere (who remains nameless  like all characters in the novella) visits Flatland at the turn of each millennium to introduce a new apostle to the idea of a third dimension in the hopes of eventually educating the population of Flatland of the existence of Spaceland  From the safety of Spaceland  they are able to observe the leaders of Flatland secretly acknowledging the existence of the sphere and prescribing the silencing of anyone found preaching the truth of Spaceland and the third dimension  After this proclamation is made  many witnesses are massacred or imprisoned (according to caste)  After the Square mind is opened to new dimensions  he tries to convince the Sphere of the theoretical possibility of the existence of a fourth (and fifth  and sixth    ) spatial dimension  Offended by this presumption and incapable of comprehending other dimensions  the Sphere returns his student to Flatland in disgrace  The Square then has a dream in which the Sphere visits him again  this time to introduce him to Pointland  The point (sole inhabitant  monarch  and universe in one) perceives any attempt at communicating with him as simply being a thought originating in his own mind (cf  Solipsism): The Square recognizes the connection between the ignorance of the monarchs of Pointland and Lineland with his own (and the Sphere) previous ignorance of the existence of other  higher dimensions  Once returned to Flatland  the Square finds it difficult to convince anyone of Spaceland existence  especially after official decrees are announcedanyone preaching the lies of three dimensions will be imprisoned (or executed  depending on caste)  Eventually the Square himself is imprisoned for just this reason  where he spends the rest of his days attempting to explain the third dimension to his brother ,1,0,0,0,0

394,Good Omens,It is the coming of the End Times: the Apocalypse is near  and Final Judgment will soon descend upon the human race  This comes as a bit of bad news to the angel Aziraphale (who was the angel of the Garden of Eden) and the demon Crowley (who  when he was originally named Crawly  was the serpent who tempted Eve to eat the apple)  respectively the representatives of God and Satan on Earth  as they have become used to living their cozy  comfortable lives and have  in a perverse way  taken a liking to humanity  As such  since they are good friends (despite ostensibly representing the polar opposites of Good and Evil)  they decide to work together and keep an eye on the Antichrist  destined to be the son of a prominent American diplomat stationed in Britain  and thus ensure he grows up in a way that means he can never decide between Good and Evil  thereby postponing the end of the world  Unfortunately  Warlock  the child everyone thinks is the Anti Christ is  in fact  a perfectly normal eleven year old boy  Due to mishandling of several infants in the hospital  the real Anti Christ is Adam Young  a charismatic and slightly otherworldly eleven year old who  despite being the harbinger of the Apocalypse  has lived a perfectly normal life as the son of typical English parents and as a result has no idea of his true powers  As Adam blissfully and naively uses his powers  creating around him the world of Just William (because he thinks that is what an English child life should be like)  the race is on to find him&mdash;the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse assemble and the incredibly accurate (yet so highly specific as to be useless) prophecies of Agnes Nutter  seventeenth century prophetess  are rapidly coming true  Agnes Nutter was a witch in the 17th century and the only truly accurate prophet to have ever lived  She wrote a book called The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter  Witch  a collection of prophecies that did not sell very well because they were unspectacular  cryptic and  ironically enough  all true  She  in fact  decided to publish it only so that she could receive a free author copy  There is only one copy of the book left  which belongs to her descendant Anathema Device  Agnes was burned at the stake by a mob (because that is what mobs did at that time); however  because she had foreseen her fiery end (Ye're tardy; I should have been aflame ten minutes since) and had packed 80 pounds of gunpowder and 40 pounds of roofing nails into her petticoats  everyone who participated in the burning was killed instantly  Anathema teams up with Newton Pulsifer  the descendant of the man who initiated the burning of Agnes  to use the prophesies and find the Antichrist  Unfortunately  that is exactly what everyone else is trying to do  and time is running out ,1,0,0,0,0
395,Coraline, This is about a different girl named Coraline Jones  She and her parents move into an old house that has been subdivided into flats  The other tenants include Miss Spink and Miss Forcible  two elderly women retired from the stage  and Mr  Bobinski  who is training a mouse circus  The flat beside Coraline remains empty  During a rainy day she discovers a locked door in the drawing room  which has been bricked up  As she goes to visit her neighbors  Mr  Bobinsky relates to her a message from the mice: Do not go through the door  At tea with Miss Spink and Miss Forcible  Miss Spink spies danger in Coraline‚Äôs future after reading her tea leaves  and gives her a stone with a hole in it for protection  Despite these warnings  Coraline decides to unlock the door when she is home by herself and finds the brick wall behind the door gone  In its place is a long passageway  which leads to a flat identical to her own  inhabited by her Other Mother and Other Father  who are replicas of her real parents  They have button eyes and exaggerated features  In this ‚ÄúOther World‚Äù  Coraline finds everything to be better than her reality: her Other Parents are attentive  her toy box is filled with animate toys that can move and fly  and the Other Miss Spink and Miss Forcible forever perform a cabaret show in their flat  She even finds the feral Black Cat that wanders around the house in the real world can talk  however she learns he is not of the Other World; he only travels from one world to another and warns Coraline of the imminent danger  but Coraline pays him no heed  The Other Mother offers Coraline a chance to stay in the Other World forever  if Coraline will allow buttons to be sewn into her eyes  Coraline is horrified and returns back through the door to go home  Upon her return to her apartment  Coraline finds her real parents are missing  They do not return the next day  and the black cat wakes her and takes her to a mirror in her hallway  through which she can see her trapped parents  They signal to her by writing Help Us on the glass  from which Coraline deduces the Other Mother has kidnapped them  Though frightened of returning  Coraline goes back to the Other World to confront the Other Mother and rescue her parents  In the garden  Coraline is prompted by the Cat to challenge the Other Mother  as ‚Äúher kind of thing loves games and challenges‚Äù  The Other Mother tries to convince Coraline to stay  but Coraline refuses  and is locked behind a mirror as punishment  In the darkness  she meets three ghost children  each from a different era  who had let the beldam (the Other Mother) sew buttons in their eyes  They tell her how she eventually grew bored with them  ate their bodies  and cast their spirits aside  The ghost children implore Coraline to avoid their fate  and to help find their souls so that they can leave the Other World and pass on  After the Other Mother releases Coraline from the mirror  Coraline proposes a game in which she must find the ghost children‚Äôs souls and her parents  which lay hidden throughout the Other World  If Coraline wins  she  her parents and the ghost children may go free  If not  Coraline will let the Other Mother sew the buttons into her eyes  Coraline goes through the Other World  and overcomes all the Other Mother‚Äôs obstacles  using her wits and Miss Spink‚Äôs stone to locate the ghost children‚Äôs souls  At the close of the game  the ghost children warn her even if Coraline wins  the Other Mother will not let them go  Having deduced her parents are imprisoned in the snow globe on the mantle  Coraline tricks the Other Mother by saying her parents are behind the door in the drawing room  As the Other Mother opens the door  Coraline throws the cat at the Other Mother  grabs the snow globe  and escapes to the real world with the key  In doing so  she forces the door shut on the Other Mother hand  severing it  Back in her home  Coraline finds her parents safe and with no memory of the events  That night  Coraline has a dream in which she meets the three children before they move on to the afterlife  They warn her  her task is still not done: the other mother severed hand is in Coraline world  attempting to steal the key which opens the door that connects the two worlds  Coraline goes to an old well in the woods by her house  luring the Other Mother‚Äôs hand there with the key  and casts both down the bottomless well  Coraline returns home  victorious  and prepares to go about the ordinary life she has come to accept and love ,0,1,0,0,0
396,The Sandman: Dream Country,Like the sixth collection  Fables and Reflections  and the eighth  Worlds' End  Dream Country consists of short stories that do not have a common storyline running through them  though it has been argued that most Sandman stories are not entirely self contained and are part of a larger story arc that encompasses the entire series  Dream Country is the shortest of the eleven Sandman collections  featuring just four issues (Calliope  #17  and A Dream of a Thousand Cats  #18  both pencilled by Kelley Jones and inked by Malcolm Jones III; A Midsummer Night Dream  #19  drawn by Charles Vess and coloured for the first time by computer colouring pioneer Steve Oliff; and Fa√ßade  #20  penciled by Colleen Doran and inked by Malcolm Jones III)  This is the story of a frustrated author  Richard Madoc  whose first book has been released to critical acclaim but who simply cannot write a page of the promised follow up  He strikes a deal with an elder writer  Erasmus Fry  for Calliope  one of the Muses of Greek mythology  whom Fry had captured earlier in his life  in exchange for a bezoar  Fry kept her imprisoned and regularly raped her  and her presence provided the inspiration for his successful novels  Madoc also takes her captive and has great success in writing  but Calliope calls upon the triad of witches known by many names  such as the Furies  the Kindly Ones or the Gracious Ladies  for help  They direct her to Morpheus  who we are told was once her lover (this relationship is elaborated on later in the series)  and who is currently similarly imprisoned  Upon his release  he comes to rescue Calliope  and visits a terrible punishment upon Madoc  He complains that without her  he will have no ideas  so Morpheus causes him to never stop having them  which drives him to madness  Though the story of Calliope was not criticized for unoriginality at the time of its release  its concept has apparently become a very popular one since; a list of overused story ideas at Strange Horizons included Creative person meets a muse (either one of the nine classical Muses or a more individual muse) and interacts with them  usually by keeping them captive  (See Neil Gaiman post about Strange Horizon list)  Madoc Book Her Wings appears in a few other stories by Neil Gaiman including The Last Temptation as a sort of inside joke  Rose Walker is later seen reading Fry book Here Comes a Candle  In the library of Dream  an unfinished book by Erasmus Fry  The Hand of Glory is seen in Season of Mists  One of Madoc works  The Spirit Who Had Half Of Everything  takes its name from an unused chapter title in an early draft of James Branch Cabell Figures of Earth  This tale begins with a small  white cat being called by another cat to sneak away from her house one night  They speak of an event in a graveyard that they do not want to miss  When they arrive  they see that many cats are already there  A Siamese cat comes to tell her story  A long time ago  the Siamese cat relates  she met a Tom cat  who became her lover  Eventually  she gave birth to several kittens  Her human owners were not pleased  and the male owner put the kittens in a bag bound to a rock  and threw them into pond  Traumatized by the callous murder of her kittens  the Siamese becomes disillusioned in human beings and ultimately rejects the life of a pampered pet  Her cause is strengthened when she has a dream that she has entered a boneyard in the Dreaming  In the dream a raven with no skin on its head informs her where she can find out exactly why the humans killed her offspring: a cave inhabited by the Dream Lord  At the entrance to the cave that the raven told her of  many fearsome animals tell her to leave  She responds by saying that she will only state her business to Dream  Inside  she finds Dream in the form of a cat  Dream presents her with a vision of an alternate reality where cats are huge and humans are merely their playthings  tiny servants which groom their bodies and which the cats can kill at their leisure  A man ruined that world by informing the humans that their dreams will shape the world  Enough humans listened to make the vision a reality  Upon waking  the cat undertakes a spiritual quest for justice  She preaches her vision to motley assortments of housecats around the world  hoping that if she can make enough believe in and dream of this reality  the world will change to conform to their dreams  The cat from the beginning of the story heads home  Her friends were slightly disappointed  though they admitted that what they heard was interesting  The white cat  however  was fully taken by the tale  She returns home and heads to sleep  Over breakfast  her owners remark on what a cute stance she is in: it looks as if she is hunting something  or someone  Although seemingly a complete diversion from the basic story of the Sandman  it in fact illustrates some of the core themes of the series: the idea that reality is shaped in the most literal sense by the dreams  beliefs  and expectations of humans (and  in this case  of other animals as well)  The story also portrays the theme of change and its relation to an individual nature  The humans found that they were unhappy with their role and were able to harness the power of dream to instigate a change of the nature of reality  whereas when cats found themselves in a similar situation their apathetic  independent  and fickle nature kept them from changing  This idea of the capacity for change reemerges throughout the book  most notably in the conclusion of The Kindly Ones  !   This section is linked from Characters of The Sandman   > This is a core issue of the Sandman series  sometimes cited as the best in the series  It concerns the premiere of William Shakespeare A Midsummer Night Dream  which we are told was commissioned by Morpheus as part of a bargain in which Morpheus granted Shakespeare his extraordinary skill with writing  Performed on a hillside before an audience of bizarre creatures from Faerie   including the very characters who appear in the play  Titania  Auberon  and the hobgoblin Robin Goodfellow (Puck) amongst them   the Sandman version of reality and Shakespeare play are merged and interact with one another  Puck greatly enjoys the play and repeats the theme of the story that while the play does not directly reflect history or even some of the personalities of the characters it is still considered a true reflection of reality  (In reality Puck is described as being a psychotic murderer and not a merry wanderer of the night ) Titania takes an interest in Shakespeare son Hamnet  who plays a small role in the play  The issue received a World Fantasy Award for short fiction in 1991  Dream first meets Shakespeare in Sandman #13  &#34;Men of Good Fortune &#34; and the final issue  #75  &#34;The Tempest &#34; focuses on the second of the two plays commissioned by Morpheus  This is another odd issue  featuring one of the methods Gaiman played with in the first  and to a lesser extent in the second  collection: it takes one of the neglected characters from the DC Universe  this time Element Girl (Urania Blackwell  a female version of Metamorpho)  and shows her in a completely unexpected situation  A reluctant superhero at best  she has now retired  and lives a meagre existence  rarely leaving her flat due to her self loathing of her &#34;freakish&#34; appearance  She goes by her nickname &#34;Rainie&#34;  The plot revolves around a phone call she receives: an invitation to have dinner with an old friend  Della  She concocts a fake face to wear so her friend doesn&#39;t know of her &#34;skin disease&#34;  As Della explains a problem she&#39;s having  Rainie&#39;s &#34;face&#34; falls into the plate of spaghetti bolognese that she ordered  revealing her true face  She runs away  and to her apartment  where she wonders how she can kill herself  despite being invulnerable  Fortunately  Death  who was dealing with a woman who&#39;d slipped on a stepladder  enters her room  explaining that the door was open  and she had heard her crying  She tells her how she can talk to the sun god  Ra  and beg for a merciful death  An extraordinarily poignant piece dealing with identity and  subtly  the gap between the world portrayed in the more na√Øve of DC Comics&#39; superhero comics and the true reality of everyday life  it ends on a curiously happy note  with Death answering Rainie&#39;s telephone and informing the caller that &#34;she&#39;s gone away  I&#39;m afraid &#34;,0,1,0,0,0
397,Interview with the Vampire,A vampire named Louis tells his 200 year long life story to reporter Daniel Molloy (who is only referred to as the boy in the novel)  In 1791  Louis was a young indigo plantation owner living south of New Orleans  Louisiana  Distraught with the death of his pious brother  he seeks death in any way possible  Louis is approached by a vampire named Lestat  who desires Louis' company  Lestat turns Louis into a vampire (although initially Louis begs to be killed) and the two become immortal companions  Lestat spends some time feeding off the local plantation slaves while Louis  who finds it morally impossible for him to murder humans to survive  feeds from animals  Louis and Lestat are forced to leave when Louis' slaves begin to fear the monsters with which they live and instigate an uprising  Louis sets his own plantation aflame; he and Lestat exterminate the plantation slaves to keep word from spreading about vampires living in Louisiana  Gradually  Louis bends under Lestat influence and begins feeding from humans  He slowly comes to terms with his vampire nature but also becomes increasingly repulsed by what he perceives as Lestat total lack of compassion for the humans he preys upon  Escaping to New Orleans proper  Louis feeds off a plague ridden young girl one night  who is six years old  whom he finds next to the corpse of her mother  Louis begins to think of leaving Lestat and going his own way  Fearing this  Lestat then turns the girl into a vampire daughter for them  to give Louis a reason to stay  She is then given the name Claudia  Louis is initially horrified that Lestat has turned a child into a vampire  but soon begins to care for Claudia tenderly and dotingly  Claudia takes to killing people easily  but over time  she grows tired of her eternal childhood and begins to realize she can never grow up; her mind matures into that of an intelligent  assertive woman  but her body remains that of a five year old girl  Claudia blames Lestat for her condition and  after 60 years of living together  she hatches a plot to destroy Lestat by poisoning him and cutting his throat  Claudia and Louis then dump his body into a nearby swamp  After realizing that they seem to now be the only vampires living in America  Claudia desires to travel to Europe with Louis and seek out Old World vampires  As Louis and Claudia prepare to flee to Europe  Lestat appears  having survived and recovered from Claudia attack  and attacks them in turn  Louis sets fire to their home and barely escapes with Claudia  leaving a furious Lestat to be consumed by the flames  Arriving in Europe  Louis and Claudia seek out more of their kind  They travel throughout eastern Europe first and do indeed encounter vampires  but these vampires appear to be nothing more than animated corpses  mindless and unintelligible  It is only when they reach Paris that they encounter vampires like themselves   specifically  the 400 year old vampire Armand and his coven  the Th√©√¢tre des Vampires  Inhabiting an ancient theater  Armand and his vampire coven disguise themselves as humans and feed on live  terrified humans in mock plays before a live human audience (who think the killings are merely a very realistic performance)  Claudia is repulsed by these vampires and what she considers to be their cheap theatrics  but Louis and Armand are drawn to each other  Santiago  a prominent figure among the vampire coven  suspects Claudia and Louis of killing their maker  One rule among the vampires is death to any vampire who kills their own kind  Convinced that Louis will leave her for Armand  Claudia demands that Louis turn a human Parisian doll maker  Madeleine  into a vampire to serve as both a mother figure and a replacement companion  Louis at first refuses but eventually gives in and makes Madeleine into a vampire  Louis  Madeleine and Claudia live together for a brief time  but all three are abducted one night by the Theatre vampires  Lestat has arrived   having survived the fire and attempted murder in New Orleans  His accusations against Louis and Claudia result in Louis being locked in a coffin to starve  while Claudia and Madeleine are locked in an open courtyard  Armand arrives and releases Louis from the coffin  but Madeleine and Claudia are burned to death by the rising sun  Louis finds the ashen remains of Claudia and Madeleine and is devastated  He later returns to the Theatre late the following night  burning it to the ground as the sun rises and killing all the vampires inside  and leaves with Armand  Louis and Armand then travel across Europe together for several years  but Louis never fully recovers from Claudia death and the emotional connection between himself and Armand quickly dissolves  Tired of the Old World  Louis eventually returns to America and New Orleans in the early 20th century  living as a loner; he feeds off any humans that cross his path but lives in the shadows and never creates another companion for himself  Telling the boy of one last encounter with Lestat in New Orleans  Louis ends his tale; after 200 years  he is weary of immortality as a vampire and all the pain and suffering to which he has had to bear witness  The boy  however  seeing only the great powers granted to a vampire  begs to be made into a vampire himself  Infuriated that his interviewer learned nothing from his story  Louis refuses  and attacks the boy and then vanishes without a trace  Recovering from the attack  the boy leaves the place in his car ,0,1,0,0,0

399,The Languages of Pao, The planet Pao is a quiet backwater with a large  homogeneous  stolid population ruled by an absolute monarch: the Panarch  The current Panarch attempts to hire an offworld scientist  Lord Palafox from the Breakness Institute on the planet Breakness  as a consultant in order to reform Pao  Before the deal can be concluded  however  the Panarch is assassinated by his brother Bustamonte  using mind control over the Panarch own son  Beran Panasper  to do so  Lord Palafox saves Beran Panasper and takes him to Breakness as a possible bargaining chip in his dealings with Pao  Somewhat later  the predatory Brumbo Clan from the planet Batmarsh raids the virtually defenseless Pao with impunity  and the Panarch Bustamonte is forced to pay heavy tribute  To rid himself of the Brumbos  he seeks the aid of Palafox  who has a plan to create warrior  technical and mercantile castes on Pao using customized languages (named Valiant  Technicant and Cogitant) and other means to shape the mindsets of each caste  isolating them from each other and the general populace of Pao  To achieve this  each caste gets a special training area where it is completely segregated from any outside influence; the necessary land is confiscated from families  some of which have held it for countless generations&nbsp;‚Äî which creates some disaffection in the conservative Paonese population and earns Bustamonte the name of a tyrant  In order to return with them to Pao incognito  Beran Panasper infiltrates a corps of interpreters being trained on Breakness  Mostly to amuse themselves  some of the young people create a language they call Pastiche  mixing words and grammatical forms  seemingly at random  from the three newly created languages and from the original Paonese language  Palafox looks upon this development with indulgence  failing to realize the tremendous long term significance  Beran returns to Pao under the name Ercolo Paraio and works for a few years as a translator at several locations  Once Beran Panasper reveals to the masses that he is still alive  his uncle Bustamonte popular support melts virtually overnight and Panasper claims the title of Panarch that is rightfully his  The Brumbo Clan is repulsed by the warrior caste  For a few years  the castes of Pao are highly successful in their respective endeavors and the planet experiences a short golden age  However  Panasper is upset about the divisions in the populace of Pao caused by the Palafox program; the three new castes speak of the rest of the Paonese as they rather than we and regard them with contempt  Beran attempts to return the planet to its previous state by re integrating the castes into the general populace  Palafox opposes this move and is killed  but the warrior caste stages a coup and takes command of Pao  Panasper convinces them that they cannot rule the planet alone  since they share no common language with the rest of the population and can not rely on the cooperation of the other segments of the people of Pao  and they allow him to keep his office  One interpretation of the end of the novel is that Beran Panasper is only in nominal charge of the planet  on the sufferance of the warrior caste  and that it is uncertain what will become of him and his plans of re uniting the populace of Pao  Another way of seeing the ending is that Beran has outfoxed the warriors by getting them to agree to his decree that every child of Pao  of whatever caste  must learn Pastiche even in preference to the language of his father  In the end  Beran looks ahead twenty years  to a future when all inhabitants of Pao will be Pastiche speakers&nbsp;‚Äî i e   will speak a language which mixes some attributes and mindsets appropriate to peasant cultivators  proud warriors  skilled technicians and smart merchants&nbsp;‚Äî which will presumably shape a highly fluid and socially mobile society  composed of versatile and multi skilled individuals ,1,0,0,0,0
400,Cat Cradle,At the opening of the book  the narrator  an everyman named John (a k a  Jonah)  describes a time when he was planning to write a book about what important Americans did on the day Hiroshima was bombed  While researching this topic  John becomes involved with the children of Felix Hoenikker  a Nobel laureate physicist who helped develop the atomic bomb  John travels to Ilium  New York  to interview the Hoenikker children and others for his book  In Ilium John meets  among others  Dr  Asa Breed  who was the supervisor on paper of Felix Hoenikker  As the novel progresses  John learns of a substance called ice nine  created by the late Hoenikker and now secretly in the possession of his children  Ice nine is an alternative structure of water that is solid at room temperature  When a crystal of ice nine contacts liquid water  it becomes a seed crystal that makes the molecules of liquid water arrange themselves into the solid form  ice nine  John and the Hoenikker children eventually end up on the fictional Caribbean island of San Lorenzo  one of the poorest countries on Earth  where the people speak a barely comprehensible creole of English (for example twinkle  twinkle  little star is rendered Tsvent kiul  tsvent kiul  lett pool store)  It is ruled by the dictator  Papa Monzano  who threatens all opposition with impalement on a giant hook  San Lorenzo has an unusual culture and history  which John learns about while studying a guidebook lent to him by the newly appointed US ambassador to the country  He learns about an influential religious movement in San Lorenzo  called Bokononism  a strange  postmodern faith that combines irreverent  nihilistic  and cynical observations about life and God will with odd  but peaceful rituals (for instance  the supreme act of worship is an intimate act consisting of prolonged physical contact between the bare soles of the feet of two persons  supposed to result in peace and joy between the two communicants)  Though everyone on the island seems to know much about Bokononism and its founder  Bokonon  the present government calls itself Christian and those caught practising Bokononism are punished with death by the giant hook  As the story progresses  it becomes clear that San Lorenzon society is more bizarre and cryptic than originally revealed  In observing the interconnected lives of some of the island most influential residents  John learns that Bokonon himself was at one point a de facto ruler of the island  along with a US Marine deserter  The two men created Bokononism as part of a utopian project to control the population  The ban was an attempt to give the religion a sense of forbidden glamour  and it is found that almost all of the residents of San Lorenzo  including the dictator  practice the faith  and executions are rare  When John and the other travelers arrive on the island  they are greeted by President Papa Monzano and around five thousand San Lorenzans  It becomes clear that Papa Monzano is extremely ill  and he intends to name Franklin Hoenikker his successor  Franklin  uncomfortable with this arrangement  abruptly hands the presidency to John  who grudgingly accepts  The dictator later uses ice nine to commit suicide rather than succumb to his inoperable cancer  Consistent with the properties of ice nine  the dictator corpse instantly turns into solid ice at room temperature  During John inauguration festivities  in which the American ambassador to San Lorenzo was going to speak  San Lorenzo small air force was supposed to present a brief air show  One of the airplanes crashes into the dictator seaside palace and causes his still frozen body to tumble into the ocean  and all the water in the world seas  rivers  and groundwater turns into ice nine  killing almost all life in a few days  John manages to escape with his wife  a native San Lorenzan named Mona  They later discover a mass grave where all the surviving San Lorenzans had killed themselves with ice nine  on the facetious advice of Bokonon  Displaying a mix of grief and resigned amusement  Mona kills herself as well  John takes refuge with a few other survivors (an American couple he had met on the plane to San Lorenzo and Felix Hoenikker two sons)  and lives in a cave for several months  during which time he writes a memoir revealed to be the novel itself  The book ends by his meeting a weary Bokonon  who is contemplating what the last words of The Books of Bokonon should be  Bokonon states that if he were younger  he would have climbed to the top of Mt  McCabe and placed a book about human stupidity at the top  The Republic of San Lorenzo is a fictional country where much of the book second half takes place  San Lorenzo is a tiny  rocky island nation located in the Caribbean Sea  positioned in the relative vicinity of Puerto Rico  San Lorenzo has only one city  its seaside capital of Bolivar  The country form of government is a dictatorship  under the rule of ailing president Papa Monzano  who is a staunch ally of the United States and a fierce opponent of communism  No legislature exists  The infrastructure of San Lorenzo is described as being dilapidated  consisting of worn buildings  dirt roads  an impoverished populace  and having only one automobile taxi running in the entire country  The language of San Lorenzo is a fictitious English based creole language that is referred to as the San Lorenzan dialect  The San Lorenzan national anthem is based on the tune of Home on the Range  Its flag consists of a United States  Marine Corps corporal stripes on a blue field (presumably the flag was updated  since in the 1920s Marine Corps rank insignia did not include crossed rifles)  Its currency is named corporals  at a rate of two corporals for every United States dollar; both the flag and the monetary unit are named after United States  Marine Corporal Earl McCabe  who deserted his company while stationed at Port au Prince during the American occupation in 1922  and in transit to Miami  was shipwrecked on San Lorenzo  McCabe  along with accomplice Lionel Boyd Johnson from Tobago  would together throw out the island governing sugar company  and after a period of anarchy  proclaimed a republic  San Lorenzo also has its own native religion  Bokononism  a religion based on enjoying life through its untruths  Bokononism  founded by McCabe accomplice Boyd Johnson (pronounced Bokonon in San Lorenzan dialect)  however  is outlawed   an idea Bokonon himself conceived for the purpose of spreading the religion and making the residents of the island happier  Bokononists are liable to be punished by being impaled on a hook  but Bokononism privately remains the dominant religion of nearly everyone on the island  including the leaders who outlaw it  Officially  San Lorenzo is a Christian nation  However  both Catholicism and Protestantism are illegal  This leads to a rather haphazard issuing of last rites ,1,0,0,0,0

Randy then meets Mark arriving plane  While the military jet is refueled  Mark explains to Randy the background for sending the urgent message  The Soviets evidently perceive a temporary weakness in United States  and Allied defense posture and are believed to be staging an attempt to take advantage of the situation  A defecting Soviet military officer has brought the Soviet war plan to the West  Mark believes the Soviet plan is flawed and that the West would ultimately prevail  but danger lies in Moscow belief that they can succeed  which emboldens them to risk war  Mark informs Randy that he is flying his family down to Florida to stay with him indefinitely   or until Mark feels the threat has passed  The brothers soon say their goodbyes  and Randy realizes that he may never see Mark again  Heading back to Fort Repose  Randy gets cash from the bank  He also privately gives warning of the impending war to those people of Fort Repose whom he believes to be his friends  including Dr  Daniel Gunn (perhaps Randy closest friend in Fort Repose) as well as Elizabeth Lib McGovern  a young woman for whom Randy has come to care deeply  During the early hours of the next morning  Randy drives to Orlando Municipal Airport to meet his sister in law (Helen) and her young son and daughter (Ben Franklin and Peyton) arriving from Omaha  Meanwhile  in the Eastern Mediterranean  a United States  Navy carrier task force is being shadowed by unidentified (and presumably hostile) aircraft  The aircraft carrier USS Saratoga launches a fighter aircraft to intercept  identify and (if necessary) shoot down the bogie  United States  Navy Ensign Pee Wee Cobb  one of the most junior pilots in Saratogas air wing  is flying the interceptor  an F11F Tiger jet fighter  off the coast of Syria (a Soviet ally) and locates the unidentified aircraft  He is given permission to pursue and attack  Cobb closes on the bogie and fires an AIM 9 Sidewinder heat seeking missile  but the missile goes off course because the enemy plane shuts off its engines  and the missile hits an ammunition depot at Latakia  Syria  resulting in an explosion that may or may not have included nuclear devices  This event becomes the apparent casus belli for the Soviet Union to launch a preemptive nuclear strike against the United States and her allies  Early the following morning  Mark is on duty at SAC headquarters at Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha  Nebraska  known as The Hole  He and fellow officers express concern that reports of unidentified submarines (skunks) approaching the US Eastern seaboard overnight  coupled with Moscow unsettling silence following the attack at Latakia may signal the Kremlin is preparing to launch an attack  Mark recommends to SAC commander  General Hawker  that SAC ask Washington to transfer the direct authority to use nuclear weapons  since the weapons release process takes at least a minute and a half  and the United States  expects only about a fifteen minute warning if the Soviet Union were to attack  This is granted  Minutes later  radar stations report what appear to be inbound Soviet missiles from over the Arctic  as well as possible submarine launched missiles heading toward the East Coast  Mark realizes what he feared most has arrived and turns to walk back to his office  General Hawker orders all SAC facilities to go immediately to Red Alert  As Mark leaves  General Hawker says to him  Thanks for the 95 seconds  In Fort Repose  Randy and his house guests are awakened by shaking due to the bombing of Miami and nearby Homestead Air Force Base  While looking at the glow to the south caused by the destruction of Miami  the family sees the nuclear explosion and mushroom cloud that destroys Tampa and MacDill Air Force Base  and which temporarily blinds Randy niece  Peyton  These events culminate in what will later be called The Day by the residents of Fort Repose       in effect  a one day war  The effects of The Day on Fort Repose are varied  Tourists are trapped in their hotels and the local bank manager tries to get instructions from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta  via telegraph lines routed through Jacksonville (who already announced no messages will be sent North)  But Jacksonville  as the home of Naval Station Mayport  Naval Air Station Jacksonville and Naval Air Station Cecil Field  is then destroyed by a follow on Soviet nuclear strike and no advice is available  The local disc jockey at Fort Repose AM radio station nervously reads instructions on the CONELRAD system  The only reliable method of news from the outside world is a shortwave radio receiver owned by one of Randy neighbors  Sam Hazzard  a retired United States  Navy rear admiral  Convicts escape from jails and prisons; the local retirement homes are filled with panicked people; and a run on the bank results in the bank closing and local merchants selling out of nearly all supplies  As the effects of the disintegration of society get worse  many prominent people fail  The local banker  Edgar Quisenberry  commits suicide once he realizes money is useless  Randy political rival  Porky Logan  who obtained looted radioactive jewelry near Miami  becomes seriously ill with radiation sickness  Randy organizes his immediate neighbors to provide housing  food  and water for themselves  organizes the community into self defense  guides his family  and helps find salt and new supplies of food when they grow short  He fights the highwaymen who murder residents and seriously assault Dr  Gunn in their search for narcotics and goods  Some in Fort Repose discover faith; others degenerate into drunkenness  Randy eventually learns that  as an active Army Reserve officer  he has the legal right to exercise martial law ‚Äî shortly after he had already begun to do so  albeit in a de facto mode  The authority comes from an order of acting Chief Executive Josephine Vanbruuker Brown (who prior to The Day had been the Secretary of Health  Education and Welfare  and is believed to be governing the country from Denver  Colorado) for any surviving active duty  reserve or national guard officers to form local militias  When Air Force helicopters finally make contact with Fort Repose again  and offer to move the families under Randy care out of the area  none leave; they have come to believe that the life they have built in Fort Repose is at least as good  if not better  than the life they would face outside  The Air Force officer commanding the element of helicopters is Randy old friend  Paul Hart  He reveals that Denver is now the national capital and that the United States won the war   but at a tremendous cost: the large scale death and destruction suffered by the United States have left it a secondary (perhaps even tertiary) world power  and is the recipient of aid from third world countries such as Brazil and Venezuela  He also advises Randy sister in law  Helen  that Mark was killed in the initial exchange that destroyed Offutt AFB and Omaha  leaving her free to marry Dr  Gunn  with whom she has now fallen in love  Paul also explains that nothing is left of Miami  Jacksonville  Tampa  and Orlando and that there are now two huge craters where McCoy AFB and downtown Orlando once stood  He also informs them that it will likely take a thousand years to get the contaminated areas decontaminated and habitable again  The book ends with the central characters bravely facing the thousand year night ahead of them ,1,0,0,0,0

minimum actions  called Reality Changes  within the temporal world in order to minimize human suffering as integrated over the whole of (future) human history  As the plot unfolds  however  it is increasingly evident that Eternity itself suffers from serious maladjustments  The Eternals feel an unspoken collective guilt which causes them to scapegoat the Technicians  the experts who actually execute Reality Changes by doing something that will alter the flow of events  The Eternals are also troubled that beyond a certain point in the future they are blocked by unknown means from entering Time  These are the Hidden Centuries  Beyond the Hidden Centuries they can emerge  but find the earth devoid of human life  A key plot element which emerges quickly as the story unfolds is the relatively static nature of the human societies in the various future centuries  and the repeated failure of space travel in all accessible centuries  We later learn that Laban Twissell (Harlan‚Äôs superior and the leading figure on the governing Council) is from a Century in the 30 000s  yet nothing much is different in that time  The protagonist is a Technician named Andrew Harlan  who finds himself involved in an ontological paradox orchestrated by his superiors  He is to secure the creation of Eternity by sending a young Eternal back in time with the mathematical knowledge to make it possible  To facilitate this Harlan superiors in Eternity allow him to pursue his study of prehistory  which is history prior to the Eternity creation that  because Eternity had not yet been created then  cannot be traveled to nor changed  This intellectual pursuit is largely frowned upon by the Eternals  especially Harlan superiors  but it becomes apparent his expert knowledge on the subject will be vital to Eternity creation  Harlan himself is in trouble with the leaders of Eternity  He has been entrapped by one of them into entering into a relationship with a non Eternal woman  No√øs Lambent  This was intended merely to prove a point about the effect of Eternity on the individuals from real time who learn of it  but it has the unintended consequence of making Harlan besotted with the woman  so much so that he smuggles her into Eternity  since he has discovered that she will cease to exist in real time when the Eternals make their next Reality Change  Harlan‚Äôs whole scheme comes apart when it is revealed the leaders are fully aware of his activities  Normally the Eternals traverse from century to century within Eternity in a kind of temporal elevator called a kettle  A special version of the kettle has been built  however  for Harlan to dispatch a young Eternal  one Brinsley Sheridan Cooper  back to the 24th century  which lies ‚Äúbeyond the downwhen terminus‚Äù accessible via Eternity and its kettle system  Cooper is carefully instructed that he is to teach the principles and technology of time travel to its historic inventor  Vikkor Mallansohn  but unbeknownst to Cooper or Harlan  he will actually become Mallansohn himself  However Harlan  filled with malice after (erroneously) concluding that Twissell has trapped him and will deprive him of No√øs  scrambles the time settings just as the special kettle departs  Cooper is trapped in the wrong time  so Eternity cannot be created  Unless something is done to change the past  Harlan‚Äôs reality  and Eternity  will be erased from existence  Twissell reveals that he too had once improperly loved a woman in Time  and manages to persuade Harlan that he sympathizes  Calming down  Harlan tries to think of a way that Cooper  also adept in the concept of Reality Change  could send him a message to return and retrieve him  Harlan believes that the apparently random target setting he chose on the kettle was the 20th century  and it occurs to him that Cooper was interested in his collection of artifacts from that time  particularly magazines  Perhaps the trapped Cooper would have found a way of leaving his SOS message in one of them  This is where Asimov‚Äôs mistaken ‚Äúmushroom cloud‚Äù appears in the novel  Harlan comes upon an ad for stock tips‚ÄîAll the Talk Of the Market  concealing the acrostic A T O M  accompanying a drawing of a mushroom cloud  The year on the masthead of the preserved publication is 1932  Since this predates the first atomic explosion  it must be a coded message from someone from the future‚Äîa reality change caused by Cooper  Before he reveals this discovery to the other Eternals  Harlan exacts a price  his lover is to be returned to him and both will go back to rescue Cooper  Once the couple arrive in 1932  Harlan reveals his last surprise  He has deduced that the woman  No√øs Lambent  is herself an agent of Reality Change  She is from those centuries the Eternals cannot enter  She does not deny it  Instead she tells Harlan that her people  who prefer to watch past time rather than travel in it or change it  discovered that Eternity was  in choosing safety for humanity  suppressing creativity  In the end this has the effect of denying humanity access to the stars  as alien species advance technologically and confine humanity to Earth  Eventually humanity will die out  millions of years in the future  leaving an empty Earth  However  if Eternity could be prevented from being created  humans would leave Earth and colonize the stars  Thus they cut themselves off from Eternity and began to plot its demise  It was not any specific Change but the very existence of any such organization as Eternity which had the deleterious effect  since when given the choice humanity would always choose safety  No√øs Lambent reveals that in order to make Eternity improbable  Harlan needs only to decide to leave Cooper stranded in 1932  She also intends to send a carefully worded letter to Italy  causing a man (presumably Enrico Fermi) to begin experimenting with the neutronic bombardment of uranium  This will start a chain of events which will lead to the first atom bomb in 1945  In the reality known up to that point  atomic power was discovered somewhat later (it is not explained when  but the 24th century had nuclear reactors  and no nuclear bombs were detonated until the 30th century)  Acquiring the technology sooner  humanity will be diverted to focus more on the science of nucleonics and therefore develop interstellar space travel instead of time travel technology  and leading to a Galactic Empire instead of Eternity  Harlan at first intends to kill No√øs and carry out his mission  but in comparing her story to that of the freakish and occasionally inhuman Eternals he has encountered  Harlan confirms his lingering suspicions that Eternity has been wrong for humanity  At the very moment he decides to help her  a Reality Change occurs and the 'kettle' linking them with Eternity vanishes into thin air ,1,0,0,0,0

416,The Tale of the Body Thief,At the beginning of the story  Lestat grows depressed and becomes remorseful because of his vampiric nature  Although he tries to limit his victims to murderers  serial killers and other criminals  he nonetheless caves into temptation once in a while and kills an innocent or someone who he feels does not necessarily deserve to die  Lestat also suffers from constant nightmares concerning his late daughter  Claudia  for whose death he blames himself  The coven of vampires formed at the end of The Queen of the Damned has long since broken up  and Lestat has become extremely lonely  Among his only remaining friends is the mortal head of the Talamasca Caste  David Talbot  who is seventy four years old  Although Lestat has repeatedly offered David the Dark Gift  David has always refused to become a vampire and keep Lestat company through eternity  Lonely and depressed  Lestat goes to the Gobi desert at dawn in a half hearted suicide attempt  When he does not die  he goes to David home in England to heal  A mysterious figure  Raglan James   the eponymous Body Thief of the story   approaches Lestat with what seems to be a cure for his ennui and depression  James sends Lestat several messages hinting that he has the ability to switch bodies  Eventually  he proposes to Lestat that the two of them trade bodies for a day  Against the advice of other vampires and David Talbot  Lestat jumps at the opportunity  Unfortunately  James has no intention of ever switching back  and Lestat is forced to scheme to regain his body  Lestat nearly dies after becoming human again   his new body is wracked by pneumonia  which he ignores during a tour of Washington D C  in the middle of winter  He is saved by the care of a nun named Gretchen  He enjoys a short love affair with Gretchen before she returns to South America  where she works in a convent  and Lestat sets out in search of his body  Lestat seeks help from other vampires but is completely ostracized by them  Marius is extremely angry at him for leaving such a powerful body to a thief and refuses to help him  Likewise Louis turns him away when he asks Louis to make his new body into a vampire  arguing that Lestat ought to be happy to be human again and also calls him out on his previous writings  accusing him of altering his actual past in favor of one that portrays him heroically  Lestat only ally is David Talbot  Drawing from the Talamasca resources on the supernatural  Talbot reveals that James was a gifted psychic who once joined the order  but was kicked out for constant theft  He is a kleptomaniac who enjoys stealing for the thrill of it &mdash; it is revealed that every single thing he owns  from his house to his body  was stolen or schemed for  However  he also has major psychological problems  and his life is a series of cycles &mdash; he gets rich by theft  then often ends up in prison  Dying of cancer several years before  James tricked the inmate of a mental institution into switching bodies with him  allowing him a type of immortality  It is James' lack of imagination and petty thievery that allow Talbot and Lestat to track him down  Despite his newfound wealth and powerful new body  James continues to steal jewelry from people  He also makes a conspicuous show of his wealth  boarding the RMS Queen Elizabeth 2  and draining victims of their blood along the ship path  The pattern allows his pursuers to easily find him  On the cruise ship  Lestat manages to regain his body with David help  but the sun is rising as he performs the switch and he must immediately flee to a safe place in which to spend the day  When he awakes in the evening he finds that both James and Talbot have disappeared  Lestat finds David in Florida and is surprised to find that his friend  despite his earlier protestations  now wants to become a vampire  However  while taking his blood  Lestat discovers a final trick &mdash; when forced out of Lestat body  James took over Talbot body instead of returning to his own  Lestat angrily attacks James  crushing his skull  The blow proves fatal   the injury damages James' brain and prevents him from leaving the dying body or trying to switch bodies before his current one dies  At this point  Tale of the Body Thief reaches a false ending  Raglan James is dead  David has begun to enjoy life in his new  young body  Lestat returns to New Orleans  reunites with Louis  and begins to renovate his old house in the French Quarter  Above all  Lestat claims that he has finally come to accept his vampiric nature  However  Lestat then warns readers not to continue if they are happy with this ending  Lestat then resumes the narrative  claiming that he has regained his evil nature  and decides to make Talbot into a vampire against his wishes  and despite the role Talbot played in saving his life when everyone else abandoned him  After having immortality forced upon him  David again disappears  Lestat looks for him for a while  but upon having no luck he gives up and returns to New Orleans &mdash;

418,On the Beach,The story is set primarily in and around Melbourne  Australia  in 1963  World War III has devastated most of the populated world  polluting the atmosphere with nuclear fallout and killing all human and animal life in the northern hemisphere  The war began with a nuclear attack by Albania on Italy and then escalated with the bombing of the United States and the United Kingdom by Egypt  Because the aircraft used in these attacks were obtained from the Soviet Union  the Soviets were mistakenly blamed  triggering a retaliatory strike on the USSR by NATO  There is also an attack by the Soviets on the People Republic of China  which may have been a response to a Chinese attack aimed at occupying Soviet industrial areas near the Chinese border  Most if not all of the bombs had cobalt that was included to enhance their radioactive properties  Global air currents are slowly carrying the lethal nuclear fallout across the Intertropical Convergence Zone to the southern hemisphere  The only parts of the planet still habitable are Australia and New Zealand  South Africa  and the southern parts of South America  although these areas are slowly succumbing to radiation poisoning as well  Life in Melbourne continues in a reasonably normal fashion  though the near complete lack of motor fuels makes travel difficult  People in Australia detect a mysterious and incomprehensible Morse code radio signal originating from Seattle  Washington  in the United States  With hope that someone has survived in the contaminated regions  one of the last American nuclear submarines  USS Scorpion  placed by its captain  Commander Dwight Towers  under Australian naval command  is ordered to sail north from its port of refuge in Melbourne (Australia southernmost major mainland city) to contact whoever is sending the signal  In preparation for this journey  the submarine makes a shorter trip to port cities in northern Australia  including Cairns  Queensland and Darwin  Northern Territory  but finds no survivors  Two Australians sail with the American crew: Peter Holmes  naval liaison officer to the Americans  and a scientist  John Osborne  Commander Towers has become attached to a young Australian woman distantly related to Osborne named Moira Davidson  who tries to cope with the impending end of human life through heavy drinking  Despite his attraction to Davidson  Towers remains loyal to his wife and children in the United States  He buys his children gifts and imagines their growing older  At one point  however  he makes it clear to Moira that he knows his family is almost certainly dead  and he asks her if she thinks he is insane for acting as if they were still alive  She replies that she does not think he is crazy  The Australian government provides citizens with free suicide pills and injections so that they can avoid prolonged suffering from radiation poisoning  Periodic reports show the steady southward progression of the deadly radiation  As communications are lost with a city it is referred to as being out  One of the novel poignant dilemmas is that of Peter Holmes  who has a baby daughter and a naive and childish wife  Mary  who is in denial about the impending disaster  Because he has been assigned to travel north with the Americans  Peter tries to explain  to Mary fury and disbelief  how to euthanize their baby and kill herself with the pill should he not return from his mission in time to help  The bachelor Osborne spends much of his time restoring a Ferrari racing car which he had purchased (along with a fuel supply) for a nominal amount following the outbreak of the war  The submarine travels to the Gulf of Alaska in the northern Pacific Ocean  where the crew determines that radiation levels are not decreasing  This finding discredits the Jorgensen Effect  a scientific theory positing that radiation levels will gradually decrease due to weather effects and potentially allow for human life to continue in southern Australia or at least Antarctica  The submarine approaches San Francisco  California  observing through the periscope that the city had been devastated and the Golden Gate Bridge has fallen  In contrast  the Puget Sound area  from which the strange radio signals come  is found to have avoided destruction due to missile defenses  One crew member  who is from Edmonds  Washington  which the expedition visits  jumps ship to spend his last days in his home town  The expedition members then sail to an abandoned Navy communications school south of Seattle  A crewman sent ashore with oxygen tanks and protective gear discovers that  although the city residents have long since perished  some of the region hydroelectric power is still working due to primitive automation technology  He finds that the mysterious radio signal is the result of a broken window sash swinging in the breeze and occasionally hitting a telegraph key  After a brief stop at Pearl Harbor  the remaining submariners return to Australia to live out what little time they have left  The characters make their best efforts to enjoy what time remains to them  speaking of small pleasures and continuing their customary activities  The Holmeses plant a garden that they will never see; Moira takes classes in typing and shorthand; Osborne and others organize a dangerous motor race that results in the violent deaths of several participants; elderly members of a gentlemen club drink up the wine in the club cellar  debate over whether to move the fishing season up  and fret about whether agriculturally destructive rabbits will survive human beings  Towers goes on a fishing trip with Davidson but they do not become sexually involved  as he wants to remain loyal to his wife  a decision Moira accepts  Government services and the economy gradually grind to a halt  In the end  Towers chooses not to remain and die with Moira but rather to lead his crew on a final mission to scuttle the submarine outside Australian territorial waters  He refuses to allow his imminent demise to turn him aside from his duty to the United States  Navy and he acts as a pillar of strength to his crew  Moira watches the departure of the submarine from an adjacent hilltop as she takes her suicide pill  imagining herself together with Towers as she dies  When Mary Holmes becomes very ill  Peter administers a lethal injection to their daughter  Even though he still feels relatively well  he and Mary take their pills simultaneously so they can die as a family  Osborne takes his suicide pill while sitting in his beloved racing car  Typically for a Shute novel  the characters avoid expressing intense emotions and do not mope or indulge in self pity  The Australians do not  for the most part  flee southward as refugees but rather accept their fate once the lethal radiation levels reach the latitudes at which they live; most of them opt for the government promoted alternative of suicide when the symptoms of radiation sickness appear ,1,0,0,0,0
419,Jack of Shadows, The novel is set in a world that is tidally locked  Thus one side of the planet is always in light  and the other in darkness  Science rules on the dayside  while magic holds sway in the night  Powerful magical entities live on the night side of the planet  and for the most part the entities' magical powers emanate from distinct loci  Jack of Shadows (a k a  Shadowjack)  the main character  is unique among the magical beings in that he draws his power not from a physical location but from shadow itself  He is nearly incapacitated in complete light or complete darkness  but given access to even a small area of shadow  his potency is unmatched  Jack only friend  the creature Morningstar  is punished by being trapped in stone at the edge of the night  to be released when dawn comes  His torso and head protrude from the rock  and he awaits the sun that will never rise  Jack seeks The Key That Was Lost  Kolwynia  The Key itself and the consequences of its use parallel Jack progress in his own endeavors  Ultimately  the Key will be responsible for Jack salvation and his doom  Fleeing the dark side  Jack gets access to a computer and uses it to recover Kolwynia  This makes him unbeatable  but not all powerful  Having made a mess of ruling with his new powers  he seeks the advice of Morningstar  who advises him to destroy The Machine at the Heart of the World  which maintains the world stability  and set it rotating  The novel ends with Jack falling  perhaps to his death  but Morningstar has been freed by the world turning and rushes to rescue him  The fate of this ambiguous hero is left untold  with Jack wondering  as he falls  if Morningstar will reach him in time ,1,0,0,0,0
420,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Harry Potter is spending another summer with his dreadful Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon  when a pair of Dementors stage an unexpected attack on Harry and his cousin Dudley  After he uses magic to defend himself and Dudley  he is temporarily expelled from Hogwarts for using magic outside of the school  despite being legally allowed to do in self defence  before it is rescinded  A few days afterwards  Harry is visited by a group of wizards and Mad Eye Moody and is whisked off to Number 12  Grimmauld Place  London  the home of Harry godfather  Sirius Black  and the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix  As Harry learns from his best friends  Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger The Order is a group of witches and wizards  led by Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore  dedicated to fighting the evil Lord Voldemort and his followers  The Order is forced to operate in secrecy  outside of the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Magic  which is headed by the dense and corrupt Cornelius Fudge  who refuses to believe that Lord Voldemort has returned  In addition  Harry learns that he and Dumbledore have been made victims of a ministry smear campaign aimed at discrediting them and their beliefs about Voldemort  Because of his use of magic  Harry fate is to be determined at a discipliniary hearing at the Ministry of Magic  which turns out to be an apparent show trial  With Dumbledore help  Harry is cleared by the Wizengamot and permitted to return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  Reunited with his best friends  Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger  Harry returns to Hogwarts and learns that Dolores Umbridge  an employee of Fudge  will be his new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher  The Sorting Hat  which traditionally sorts all new students into one of four houses  cautions the students against becoming too internally divided  Meanwhile  due to the smear campaign against him  Harry is the subject of unwanted gossip from the student body at large  and a number of people turn against him  Professor Umbridge and Harry soon clash  as she  like Fudge  refuses to believe that Voldemort has returned and punishes Harry when he points out Voldemort return by forcing him to write lines with a special quill that carves I must not tell lies into the back of his hand  Umbridge refuses to teach her students how to perform defensive spells  and before long  Fudge appoints her High Inquisitor of Hogwarts  giving her the authority to inspect all faculty members and evaluate their skills  In desperation  Harry  Hermione  and Ron form their own Defense Against the Dark Arts group  also known as the D A   or Dumbledore Army  Twenty five other students sign up  including several of Harry friends as well as the eccentric Luna Lovegood  and they meet as often as possible to learn and practice Defense spells  and learn well from Harry  One night  Harry has a vision where he inhabits the body of a large snake  and attacks Ron father  Harry wakes up horrified  and Professor McGonagall takes him to Dumbledore immediately  Dumbledore uses the portraits on the walls of his office to raise an alert  and Mr  Weasley is promptly rescued by two members of the Order  The Weasley family  accompanied by Harry and the Order  visit Arthur Weasley in St  Mungo Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries  Afterwards  Dumbledore demands that Harry take Occlumency lessons with Professor Snape  for the purpose of protecting his mind against further invasions by Lord Voldemort  During the lessons  Harry learns that a corridor he has been repeatedly visiting in his dreams is part of the Department of Mysteries  Harry is unsuccessful at Occlumency because he has such difficulty clearing his mind of all thoughts  making it difficult for him to focus on closing his mind off to all outside influence  in addition to wanting to find out what they mean  Meanwhile  his scar (from the attack in which Voldemort killed Harry parents) burns horribly every time Voldemort experiences a powerful emotion  The D A  continues to meet regularly  and Harry peers show great improvement until they are caught by Umbridge  Dumbledore takes full responsibility for the group and resigns as Headmaster  and Umbridge takes over his position  Shortly afterwards  Harry ends up viewing a memory of Snape  showing him being bullied by Harry father James and Sirius  back in their schooldays  Harry wishes desperately to contact his godfather to talk about his father  but Umbridge has been inspecting all owl posts and patrolling the fires of Hogwarts  preventing communication via the Floo Network  Ron brothers  Fred and George Weasley agree to distract Umbridge so that Harry can use her fireplace to talk to Sirius  who clears up Harry doubts about his father  Immediately afterwards  they leave Hogwarts  moving to London where they plan to open a joke shop in the wizarding town of Diagon Alley using the money Harry won the previous year in the Triwizard Tournament  The students begin taking their O W L  exams  and Harry has another vision  this time about Sirius being held captive and tortured by Voldemort  Horrified  Harry becomes determined to save him  Hermione warns Harry that Voldemort may be deliberately trying to lure Harry to the Department of Mysteries  but Harry is too concerned about Sirius to pay heed  Harry sneaks into Umbridge office  and  using her fireplace  transports himself to 12  Grimmauld Place to look for Sirius  Kreacher  the House of Black house elf  tells Harry that Sirius is at the Ministry of Magic  Harry returns to Hogwarts when he is pulled back through the fire by Umbridge to find that he and his friends have been caught in Umbridge office  Ron  Luna  Ginny  and Neville  who tried to distract Umbridge so that Harry could use her fireplace  have all been seized by Slytherins and gagged  Hermione and Harry convince Umbridge to follow them into the forest  where they claim to be hiding a weapon for Dumbledore which they had just finished and wanted to tell him about  Once in the forest  Umbridge provokes the resident herd of centaurs  and is taken into the forest by them  Harry and his friends use the school thestrals  winged skeletal horses to fly to the Ministry  Once they arrive  Harry cannot find Sirius and realises that Hermione was right  Harry also sees that one of the glass spheres has his name on it  as well as Voldemort  Harry grabs the sphere  and Death Eaters led by Lucius Malfoy surround to attack  demanding that Harry hand over the prophecy  Employing all of their Defence skills  Harry  Ron  Hermione  Ginny  Luna  and Neville have moderate success fighting the Death Eaters  but they are ultimately helped enormously by the arrival of several members of the Order  including Dumbledore  In the midst of the fight  Harry drops the glass sphere and it shatters  Sirius is killed by his own cousin  Bellatrix Lestrange  when she blasts him through the veil  Harry tries to avenge his godfather and follows Bellatrix  but is met by Voldemort at the fountain  Dumbledore appears shortly after Voldemort and the two engage in an intense duel  Voldemort fights Dumbledore to stalemate  then possesses Harry in an attempt to get Dumbledore to sacrifice Harry in the hope of killing him  Voldemort and Lestrange escape  just as Fudge appears at the Ministry  finally faced with incontrovertible evidence that the Dark Lord has returned  Dumbledore sends Harry back to school  where  after Harry has a breakdown  screaming that he is had enough of all the pain and anguish and death and destruction  he explains that the sphere was a prophecy which stated that Harry has a power that Voldemort will never know: the power of love  given to him by his mother sacrifice fifteen years earlier  The prophecy goes on to claim that neither Harry nor Voldemort can live while the other survives  Dumbledore takes this opportunity to tell Harry why he must spend his summers with the Dursleys in Little Whinging: because Harry mother died to save him  he is blessed with her love  a blessing that can be sealed only by blood  Harry Aunt Petunia  his mother sister  makes that bond complete by taking Harry into her home  As long as he still calls Little Whinging home  Harry is safe  At the end of the year  the Order warn the Dursleys they will have to answer to them should they mistreat Harry  who returns to them for the summer ,0,1,0,0,0

423,Whipping Star, In the far future  humankind has made contact with numerous other species: Gowachin  Laclac  Wreaves  Pan Spechi  Taprisiots  and Caleban (among others) and has helped to form the ConSentiency to govern among the species  After suffering under a tyrannous pure democracy which had the power to create laws so fast that no thought could be given to the effects  the sentients of the galaxy found the need for a Bureau of Sabotage (BuSab) to slow the wheels of government  thereby preventing it from legislating recklessly  In Whipping Star  Jorj X  McKie is a saboteur extraordinary  a born troublemaker who has naturally become one of BuSab best agents  As the novel opens  it is revealed that Calebans  who are beings visible to other sentient species as stars  have been disappearing one by one  Each disappearance is accompanied by millions of sentient deaths and instances of incurable insanity  Ninety years prior to the setting of Whipping Star  the Calebans appeared and offered jumpdoors to the collective species  allowing sentients to travel instantly to any point in the universe  Gratefully accepting  the sentiency didn't question the consequences  Now Mliss Abnethe  a psychotic human female with immense power and wealth  has bound a Caleban (called Fannie Mae) in a contract that allows the Caleban to be whipped to death; when the Caleban dies  everyone who has ever used a jumpdoor (which is almost every adult in the sentient world and many of the young) will die as well  The Calebans begin to disappear one at a time  leaving our plane of existence (or exiting our wave) to save themselves  As all Calebans are connected  if all were to remain in our existence  when Fannie Mae died  all Calebans would die  As each Caleban exits  millions of the ConSentiency are killed or rendered insane  McKie has to find Mliss and stop her before Fannie Mae reaches  in her words  ultimate discontinuity  but he is constrained by the law protecting private individuals by restricting the ministrations of BuSab to public entities  McKie succeeds in saving Fannie Mae by opening a jumpdoor into space which shunts a large interstellar cloud of (presumably) hydrogen into her stellar body  rejuvenating her from her torture at the hands of the Palenki henchmen hired by Mliss Abnethe ,1,0,0,0,0

428,The Postman, Despite the post apocalyptic scenario  and several action sequences  the book is largely about civilization and symbols  Each of the three sections deals with a different symbol  The first is the Postman himself  Gordon Krantz  who takes the uniform solely for warmth after he loses everything but his sleeping clothes  He wanders without establishing himself anywhere  and acts in scenes of William Shakespeare for supplies  Originally from Minnesota  he has traveled as far West as Oregon  Taking shelter in a long abandoned postal van  he finds a sack of mail and takes it to a nearby community to barter for food and shelter  His reputation as a real postman builds not because of a deliberate fraud (at least initially) but because people are desperate to believe  Later  in the second section  he encounters a community (Corvallis  Oregon) led by Cyclops  apparently a sentient artificial intelligence created at Oregon State University which miraculously survived the cataclysm  In reality  however  the machine had ceased functioning during a battle; a group of scientists merely maintain the pretense of it working to try and keep hope  order  and knowledge alive  Eventually  in the third section  as the Postman joins forces with the Cyclops scientists in a war against an influx of hypersurvivalists  he begins to find that the hypersurvivalists are being pressed from the Rogue River area to the south as well  The hypersurvivalists are more commonly referred to as Holnists  after the founder of their ideal  Nathan Holn  Many times through the book  curses are uttered which damn Holn for his actions  Nathan Holn was an author who championed an extreme  violent  misogynistic and hypersurvivalist society  Holn is said to have himself been hanged in the novel  but in the time following what should have been a brief period of civil disorder  followers of Holn prevented the United States from recovering from the limited war  and the plagues that followed  As the story ends  and he comes close to the hypersurvivalist southern enemy  he begins to find traces of them  primarily in the symbol that they rally behind: the Bear Flag of California  The final scenes give the impression that the three symbols may rally together in an effort to revive civilization  Another message of the plot deals with the backstory of the post apocalyptic world: specifically  that it was not the electronics destroying electromagnetic pulses  nor the destruction of major cities  nor the release of various bio engineered plagues that actually destroyed society: rather  it was the hypersurvivalists themselves  those who maintained stockpiles of weapons and ammunition and who preyed on humanitarian workers and other forces of order ,1,0,0,0,0
429,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets begins as Harry spends a miserable summer with his only remaining family  the Dursleys  During a dinner party hosted by his uncle and aunt  Harry is visited by Dobby  a house elf  Dobby warns Harry not to return to Hogwarts  the magical school for wizards that Harry attended the previous year  explaining that terrible things will happen there  Harry politely disregards the warning  and Dobby wreaks havoc in the kitchen  infuriating the Dursleys  The Dursleys angrily imprison Harry in his room for a while after they find from a letter that Harry is not allowed to use magic away from Hogwarts  Harry is rescued by his friend Ron Weasley and his brothers Fred and George in a flying car  and spends the rest of the summer at the Weasley home  When Harry uses Floo Powder to get to Diagon Alley he accidentally ends up in a dark arts dealing end of town  Knockturn Alley  Fortunately  he meets Hagrid who gets him back to Diagon Alley  While shopping for school supplies there with the Weasleys  Harry encounters Gilderoy Lockhart  a wizard famous for all manner of deeds  who announces he is the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher  and demands to be in a photo shoot with Harry  Harry then encounters Lucius Malfoy  a Hogwarts governor and the father of the school bully  Draco  who gets into an argument with Ron father when he insults the Weasley family  As Harry prepares to return to Hogwarts  he finds that he and Ron are unable to go through the secret entrance to Platform 9 ¬æ  so they fly the Weasley car to Hogwarts  They land messily  and both boys are detained for obvious reasons  Next day Molly Weasley sends a Howler to Ron  a letter that berates him with her much louder voice  and threatens to send him home if he gets into trouble again  Lockhart quickly proves to be an incompetent teacher  more concerned with students learning about his personal accomplishments  On Halloween  something petrifies the school caretaker cat and writes a message declaring that The Chamber of Secrets has been opened  Before the cat is attacked  Harry twice hears an eerie voice  He hears it first during his detention and second during a party  moments before the cat is attacked  and third before a Quidditch match  Everybody in the school is alarmed  Harry  Ron and their other friend  Hermione Granger  learn that during the founding of Hogwarts one of the founders  Salazar Slytherin  left the school  disagreeing with the decision to teach magic to Muggle born students  According to legend  Slytherin secretly built the Chamber of Secrets  which supposedly houses a monster only Slytherin heir can control  Suspecting that Draco is the heir of Slytherin  the trio start making Polyjuice Potion  a brew which allows them to take on another form  During the school first game of Quidditch  Harry is pursued continually by a Bludger  an enchanted ball that knocks players off their brooms  despite their purpose being to unseat as many players as possible  As a result  Harry arm is broken  and Lockhart then proceeds to unintentionally remove the broken bones  That night  as he recovers from the injury  Harry is visited by Dobby  who admits to having orchestrated the platform incident and the rogue Bludger  both of which were attempts to keep Harry away from Hogwarts  Soon after  a first year student  Colin Creevy  is attacked and petrified  Lockhart begins a dueling club;

while at the same time Lucius Malfoy orchestrates the removal of Hogwarts Headmaster Albus Dumbledore for his failure to stop the attacks  As Hagrid is led away  he instructs the boys to follow the spiders  as they will be able to provide more information  Harry and Ron then sneak into the Forbidden Forest to follow the spiders  They encounter Aragog who reveals the monster who killed the girl fifty years before was not a spider  that the girl body was found in a bathroom  and that Hagrid is innocent  The boys are almost eaten by the colony of giant spiders  After they escape  Harry and Ron realize that Moaning Myrtle  the ghost who haunts the bathroom where they made the Polyjuice Potion  must have been the girl killed by the monster  A few days later  Ron and Harry discover a piece of paper with a description of a Basilisk  a giant serpent that kills all who look it directly in the eye  in Hermione petrified hand  They deduce that the Chamber monster is indeed a Basilisk  since as a snake Harry can understand what it was saying when it travelled through the schools pipes  As for the petrifications  these were due to the victims looking at the Basilisk eyes indirectly  Before the boys can act on their knowledge  the teachers announce that Ron sister Ginny Weasley has been taken into the Chamber  Lockhart arrives  and is pressured by the other teachers into venturing into the Chamber and dealing with the monster unknown to them and to him  Harry and Ron go to give him their information  only to discover that he is a fraud  Regardless  they force him to accompany them to the Chamber  The trio discovers that the entrance to the Chamber is in Myrtle bathroom  and Harry Parseltongue is able to open it  Inside the Chamber  Lockhart steals Ron wand  and attempts to wipe the memories of the other two  in order to keep his secrets safe  However  Ron wand  which has been broken since the car crash at the start of the year  deflects the spell back at Lockhart  wiping his memory  A cave in then separates him and Ron from Harry  who is forced to proceed alone  Harry finds Ginny unconscious body  as well as the almost physical form of Riddle  Riddle explains that Ginny has been talking with him via his diary  Through this  Riddle was able to possess Ginny  and use her to control the Basilisk  Ginny eventually became suspicious of the diary and tried to dispose of it in a toilet  where it was picked up by Harry  but stole it back for fear Harry would find out her role in the attacks  Riddle forced her to enter the Chamber  and possessing her soul was able to obtain a physical form  Riddle reveals that Tom Marvolo Riddle is an anagram although it is his real name for I am Lord Voldemort  who is the wizard who murdered Harry parents eleven years ago  and sets the Basilisk on Harry  Just when it seems Harry will be killed by the Basilisk  Fawkes  Dumbledore pet phoenix  appears and blinds the Basilisk  depriving it of its deadly stare  Fawkes also drops the school Sorting Hat  from which Harry draws a sword and uses it to kill the Basilisk  As he does so  one of the Basilisk fangs pierce Harry arm and Harry is saved by Fawkes  as phoenix tears have immense healing powers  Harry then stabs the diary with a Basilisk fang  defeating Riddle and saving Ginny  The five of them later leave the Chamber  Back at Hogwarts  they discover that Dumbledore has been reinstated as Headmaster  After Harry finishes explaining things to Dumbledore  Lucius Malfoy suddenly bursts in to Dumbledore office  It is implied that he had planted Riddle diary on Ginny in the first place  in the hopes of discrediting Dumbledore and the Weasleys  Discovering that Mr  Malfoy is Dobby master  Harry then tricks him into freeing Dobby by concealing a sock in the diary (clothing being the only object able to free a house elf)  All the petrified people are revived by a Mandrake Draught potion  Lockhart is sent to the wizarding hospital where he tries to regain his memories  and Hagrid returns to the school ,0,1,0,0,0
430,Creatures of Light and Darkness,The Universe was once ruled by the god Thoth  who administered the different forces in the Universe to keep things in balance  In time  he delegated this administration to his Angels (other god like beings)  who were each in charge of different stations  or forces in the Universe  Such stations included the House of the Dead  the House of Life  the House of Fire  and so on  At some point  Thoth had awakened a dormant  malevolent force on a distant planet  This dark force  called the Thing That Cries In The Night  is so powerful and malevolent that it nearly obliterated Thoth wife and threatens to consume the galaxy  Thoth works to contain and destroy the creature  and in so doing  neglects his duties in maintaining the Universe  The Angels become rebellious and use the power vacuum to fight amongst themselves for dominance Thoth son Set  who through an anomaly in Time is also his father  fights the creature across a devastated planet  Just as Set is about to destroy the creature  he is attacked by the Angel Osiris  who unleashes the Hammer That Smashes Suns  a powerful weapon that nearly kills Set and the creature  Thoth brother  Typhon  who was helping Set in the battle  vanishes without a trace and is presumed dead  (Typhon appears as a black horse shadow  without a horse to cast it  He contains within himself something called Skagganauk Abyss  which resembles a black hole  not a term in common use at the time ) The Thing That Cries In The Night survived the blast  and so Thoth  who has meanwhile been utterly overthrown by his Angels  has no choice but to contain the dark force until he can find a way to destroy it  He also revives the personality of his wife and keeps her safe on a special world known only to him  where the seas are above the atmosphere  not below them  He also scatters Set weapons and armor across the Universe for safe keeping in the event that Set can ever be found  Having been overthrown  he is now dubbed The Prince Who Was A Thousand by all in the Universe  Some of the surviving Angels either hide among the peoples of the Universe as mysterious immortals  but others‚ÄîOsiris and Anubis‚Äîtake over the House of Life and the House of Death  respectively  Other stations are abandoned  and Osiris and Anubis are the only two powers in the Universe now  Osiris cultivates life where he can  while Anubis works to destroy it  Plenty and famine  proliferation and plague  overpopulation and annihilation  alternate in the Worlds of Life between the two Stations  much to the detriment of those who inhabit them  The geography of this universe contains several curious places: * The House of Life  ruled by Osiris  contains a room in which Osiris has reduced various people in his past into furnishings  These furnishings can speak (or scream) via wall mounted speakers  ** A skull (with brain) for a paperweight  ** An enemy whose nervous system is woven into a rug  Osiris enjoys jumping on the rug  *In the House of the Dead  numerous dead people of the Six Intelligent Races lie on invisible catafalques until Anubis requires them to go through the motions of pleasure‚Äîeating  drinking  dancing  making love‚Äîwithout any real enjoyment  Anubis likes to watch  He also stages fights between champions from the Six Races: sometimes the victor gets a job‚Äîand a name  * The planet Blis is filled to bursting with people who are inexhaustibly fertile and do not know death: the whole planet is covered with 14 interlocking cities  Indeed  one man agrees to commit suicide in front of an audience  for money to be given to his family  because most people on Bliss have never seen a death  He does so by self immolation  after receiving the Possibly Proper Death Litany (also called the Agnostic Prayer)  * On fog shrouded D'donori  warlords raid each others solely to capture prisoners  who will be vivisected by the town scrier  or augur  By examining their entrails  he predicts the future and answers questions  * On an unnamed planet  the sea is above the atmosphere  Here  the Prince Who Was a Thousand keeps Nephthys  his wife  who was disembodied and cannot survive on a normal planet  * In a cave  a dog worries a glove that has seen better centuries  The three headed canine is apparently Cerberus  * On another planet  drug maddened spearmen protect and castrated priests worship a pair of old shoes ,1,0,0,0,0
431,The Handmaid Tale,The Handmaid Tale is set in the near future in the Republic of Gilead  a country formed within the borders of what was formerly the United States of America  It was founded by a racist  homophobic  christian  nativist  theocratic organized military coup as an ideologically driven response to the pervasive ecological  physical and social degradation of the country  Beginning with a staged terrorist attack (blamed on Islamic extremist terrorists) that kills the President and most of Congress  a movement calling itself the Sons of Jacob launches a revolution and suspends the United States Constitution under the pretext of restoring order  Taking advantage of electronic banking  they were quickly able to freeze the assets of all women and other undesirables in the country  stripping them of their rights  The new theocratic military dictatorship  styled The Republic of Gilead  moved quickly to consolidate its power and reorganize society along a new militarized  hierarchical  compulsorily Christian regime of Old Testament inspired social and religious orthodoxy among its newly created social classes  In this society  almost all women are forbidden to read  The story is presented from the point of view of a woman called Offred (literally Of Fred  however not a patronymic as some critics claim)  The character is one of a class of individuals kept as concubines (handmaids) for reproductive purposes by the ruling class in an era of declining births  The book is told in the first person by Offred  who describes her life during her third assignment as a handmaid  in this case to Fred (referred to as The Commander)  If Offred fails to become pregnant on this  her third attempt  she will be declared an unwoman and discarded  Interspersed in flashbacks are portions of her life from before and during the beginning of the revolution  when she finds she has lost all autonomy to her husband  through her failed attempt to escape with her husband and daughter to Canada  to her indoctrination into life as a handmaid  Through her eyes  the structure of Gilead society is described  including the several different categories of women and their circumscribed lives in the new theocracy  The Commander is a high ranking official in Gilead  Although he is only supposed to have sexual intercourse with Offred during the period called the Ceremony  a ritual at which his wife is present  he begins an illegal and ambiguous relationship with her  exposing Offred to many hidden or contraband aspects of the new society  such as fashion magazines and cosmetics  He takes her to a secret brothel run by the government  and he furtively meets with her in his study  where he allows her the contraband activity of reading  The Commander wife also had secret interactions with Offred‚Äîshe arranges for Offred to secretly have sex with her driver Nick in an effort to get her pregnant  The Commander wife believes the Commander to be sterile  a subversive belief as official Gilead policy is that only women can be sterile  In exchange for Offred cooperation  the Commander wife gives her news of her daughter  whom Offred has not seen since she and her family were captured trying to escape Gilead  After Offred initial meeting with Nick  they begin to rendezvous more frequently  Offred finds herself enjoying sex with Nick despite her indoctrination and her memories of her husband  and even goes as far as to divulge potentially dangerous information about her past  Through another handmaid  Ofglen  Offred learns of the Mayday resistance  an underground network with the intent of overthrowing Gilead  Shortly after Ofglen disappearance (later discovered to be a suicide)  the Commander wife finds evidence of the relationship between Offred and the Commander  and Offred contemplates suicide  As the novel concludes  she is being taken away by men from the secret police  known as the Eyes  in a large black van under orders from Nick  Before she is taken away  Nick tells her that the men are part of the Mayday resistance and that Offred must trust him  Offred does not know if Nick is truly a member of the Mayday resistance or if he is a government agent posing as one  and she does not know if going with the men will result in her escape or her capture  She enters the van with a final thought on her uncertain future  The novel concludes with a metafictional epilogue that explains that the events of the novel occurred shortly after the beginning of what is called the Gilead Period  The epilogue itself is a transcription of a Symposium on Gileadean Studies written some time in the distant future (2195)  and according to the symposium keynote speaker Professor Pieixoto  he and a colleague  Professor Knotly Wade  discovered Offred narrative recorded onto thirty cassette tapes  They created a probable order for these tapes and transcribed them  calling them collectively the handmaid tale  The epilogue implies that  following the collapse of the theocratic Republic of Gilead  a more equal society re emerged with a return of the legal rights of women and also Native Americans  It is

432,Small Gods, The Great God Om tries to manifest himself once more in the world  as the time of his eighth prophet is nigh  He is surprised  however  when he finds himself in the body of a tortoise  stripped of his divine powers  In the gardens of Omnia capital he addresses the novice Brutha  the only one able to hear his voice  Om has a hard time convincing the boy of his godliness  as Brutha is convinced that Om can do anything he wants  and would not want to appear as a tortoise  Brutha is gifted with an eidetic memory and is therefore chosen by Vorbis  the head of the Quisition  to come along on a diplomatic mission to Ephebe  However  Brutha is also considered unintelligent  since he never learned to read  and rarely thinks for himself  With the help of Ephebe Great Library  and the philosophers Didactylos  his nephew  Urn  and Abraxas  Om learns that Brutha is the only one left who believes in him  All others either just fear the Quisition wrath or go along with the church out of habit  While in Ephebe  Brutha memory aids an Omnian raid through the Labyrinth guarding the Tyrant palace  While in the library of Ephebe  Brutha also memorizes many scrolls in order to protect Ephebeian knowledge as Omnian soldiers set fire to the building  Fleeing the ensuing struggle by boat  Brutha  Om and a severely injured Vorbis end up lost in the desert  Trekking home to Omnia  they encounter ruined temples as well as the small gods who are faint ghost like beings yearning to be believed in to become powerful  Realizing his 'mortality' and how important his believers are to him  Om begins to care about them for the first time  While Brutha  Vorbis  and Om are in the desert  the Tyrant of Ephebe manages to regain control of the city and contacts other nations who have been troubled by Omnia imperialistic interactions with the other countries around it  On the desert edge  a recovered Vorbis attempts to finish off Om tortoise form  abducts Brutha  and proceeds to become ordained as the Eighth Prophet  Brutha is to be publicly burned for heresy while strapped on a heatable bronze turtle when Om comes to the rescue  dropping from an eagle claws onto Vorbis' head  As a great crowd witnesses this miracle they come to believe in Om and he becomes powerful again  Om manifests himself within the citadel and attempts to grant Brutha the honour of establishing the Church new doctrines  However  Brutha does not agree with Om new rule and explains that the Church should care for people while having a tolerance for other religious practices  Meanwhile  Ephebe has gained the support of several other nations and has sent an army against Omnia  establishing a beachhead near the citadel  Brutha attempts to establish diplomatic contact with the generals of the opposing army  Despite trusting Brutha  the leaders state they do not trust Omnia and that bloodshed is necessary  At the same time  Simony leads the Omnian military to the beachhead and uses Urn machine of war in order to fight the Ephebians  While the fighting occurs on the beachhead  Om attempts to physically intervene  but Brutha demands he does not interfere with the actions of humans  Om becomes infuriated but obeys Brutha  but he travels to an area of the Discworld where gods gamble on the lives of humans in order to gain or lose belief  While there  Om manages to unleash his fury  even striking the other gods  This causes the soldiers to cease fighting on the battlefield  thinking it a sign from the heavens  In the book conclusion Brutha becomes the Eighth Prophet  ending the Quisition and reforming the church to be more open minded and humanist  Om also agrees to forsake the smiting of Omnian citizens for at least a hundred years  The last moments of the book see Brutha death a hundred years to the day after Om return to power and his journey across the ethereal desert towards judgement  accompanied by the spirit of Vorbis  whom Brutha found still in the desert and took pity on  It is also revealed that this century of peace was originally meant to be a century of war and bloodshed which the History Monk Lu Tze changed to something he liked better ,1,0,0,0,0
433,Jingo,With the opening of the novel  the island of Leshp  which had been submerged under the Circle Sea for centuries  rises to the surface  Its position  exactly halfway between Ankh Morpork and Al Khali (the capital of Klatch)  makes the island a powerful strategical point for whoever lays claim to it  which both cities do  In Ankh Morpork  a Klatchian Prince named Khufurah is parading through Ankh Morpork  where he will be presented with a Degree in Sweet Fanny Adams (Doctorum Adamus cum Flabello Dulci)  but an assassination attempt occurs  and the Prince is wounded  Sir Samuel Vimes  Commander of the Ankh Morpork City Watch  begins investigating the crime  originally suspecting both a Klatchian named 71 Hour Ahmed and a senior Morporkian peer  Lord Rust  of being involved  The attempted assassination breaks off relations between Ankh Morpork and Klatch as Prince Khufurah brother effectively declares war on the city of Ankh Morpork  At this point  Havelock Vetinari  Patrician of Ankh Morpork  resigns‚Äîapparently of his own free will‚Äîand Lord Rust takes command of the city  Vetinari has refused to become involved in the war with Klatch  due to the fact Ankh Morpork does not have an army to stand against any opposing forces (the reason given being that killing enemy soldiers makes it difficult to sell them things afterwards)  but Rust declares Martial law and orders the city noble families to revive their old private regiments  Vimes  refusing to follow Rust (whom he considers to be a pillock) stands down as Commander of the Watch  Captain Carrot resigns as well  as do Sergeant Colon  Sergeant Detritus and Corporal Angua  The idea of putting the watch under the command of Corporal Nobbs is rejected by the ruling Council of Guild leaders and the Watch is disbanded  Vimes then recruits the Watch into his own private army regiment  reasoning that  as an official noble  he is entitled to do so by law and by Lord Rust command  with the group remaining independent as knights legally fall under command of the king or his duly appointed representatives  neither of which exist in Ankh Morpork  Angua  following 71 Hour Ahmed  is captured by the Klatchians and taken to Klatch  Carrot  rather than rush off to save her  reports back to Vimes  who gets his private army to head for Klatch  Meanwhile  Nobby and Sergeant Colon have been recruited by Vetinari and his pet inventor  Leonard of Quirm  on a secret mission of their own  unknown to Vimes  Vetinari  Leonard of Quirm  Colon  and Nobby end up in Leonard Going Under the Water Safely Device and discover that Leshp is actually floating on top of a huge bubble of gas (suggested to be methane or some other poisonous gas)  and that the gas is escaping from said bubble  meaning that Leshp will  ultimately  sink back under the sea again  Vimes catches up with 71 hour Ahmed and has  by this time  figured out that Ahmed is a fellow policeman  Ahmed and his band of Klatchian D'regs and Vimes army head towards Gebra  in Klatch  where the war is due to start  To help blend in  Vetinari  Nobby and Fred Colon get hold of some Klatchian clothing  though Nobby ends up wearing the costume of a dancing girl and gets in touch with his feminine side  The three also head to Gebra  Arriving at Gebra they discover that Carrot has convinced the two armies to get together and play a game of football (he has an inflatable football in his backpack for just such an emergency)  Vimes is preparing to arrest the Klatchian Prince and Lord Rust for various breaches of the peace (such as being prepared for war) and 71 hour Ahmed is supporting him  Vetinari prevents an international incident by ostensibly declaring the surrender of Ankh Morpork and offering war reparations  Vetinari is returned to Ankh Morpork  under arrest and in disgrace  but as Leshp has vanished back under the sea again  the treaty was to be signed in a non existent territory and thus the charge of treason is invalid  Sam Vimes is informed that Vetinari has been reminded that the old rank of Commander was the same as the old rank of Duke  He objects  claiming that only a King can make a Duke  but then realises that Carrot was speaking to Vetinari  Since Carrot is  of course  very much not the King of Ankh Morpork his reminding of Vetinari is all that is required for Vimes to get his new position and rank  Vimes accidentally loses his dis organiser (given to him by his wife) which kept giving him incorrect information  It is explained that  had Vimes reacted slightly differently in the beginning  staying in Ankh Morpork rather than attempting to follow Ahmed and rescue Angua   the whole history of the Ankh Morpork VS Klatch war would have gone very differently  The dis organiser meets Death at the end  but Death rejects it  Instead  he drops it into the sea  and it is swallowed by a shark where it may not have the most interesting calendar of events to deal with  but at least it finds things easy to organise ,1,0,0,0,0
434,The White Plague,When an IRA bomb goes off  the wife and children of molecular biologist John Roe O'Neill are killed on May 20  1996  Driven halfway insane by loss  his mind fragments into several personalities that carry out his plan for him  He plans a genocidal revenge and creates a plague that kills women  O'Neill then releases it in Ireland (for supporting the terrorists)  England (for oppressing the Irish and giving them a cause)  and Libya (for training said terrorists); he demands that the governments of the world send all citizens of those countries back to their countries  and that they quarantine those countries and let the plague run its course  so they will lose what he has lost; if they do not  he has more plagues to release  After releasing the plague  he goes to Ireland to hide  planning to offer his services as a molecular biologist in the hopes of sabotaging whatever work is done there on finding a cure  When he arrives in Ireland  he is suspected of being O'Neill (whom the investigatory agencies of the world have deduced is responsible)  To travel to the lab at Killaloe  he is forced to walk with a priest  a boy who has taken a vow of silence due to the death of his mother  and Joseph Herity  the IRA bomber who detonated the explosive that killed O'Neill wife and children; their purpose is to confirm his identity  either through Herity indirect questioning  or the possibility that he will confess to the priest when confronted with the pain his revenge has caused for the boy  Meanwhile  law and order have broken down in England and Ireland  and the old Irish ways are coming back  Local IRA thugs appoint themselves kings of old  and others recreate ancient Celtic pagan religions centered on the rowan tree  The IRA has effective control of Ireland  but as the governments of the world grow certain that O'Neill is there and essentially in custody  they consider wiping out the three targeted countries to end the lingering threat ,1,0,0,0,0
435,The Santaroga Barrier, A psychologist  Gilbert Dasein  is hired by corporate interests to investigate a town in a valley where marketing seems totally ineffective: Outside businesses are allowed in  but wither quickly for lack of business  Santarogans aren't hostile  they just will not shop there; neither are they xenophobic  instead appearing maddeningly self satisfied with their quaint  local lifestyle  Adding an element of danger  the last few psychologists sent in have all died in accidents that are (seemingly) perfectly plausible  Complicating matters further still  the psychologist college girlfriend  Jenny  has returned to Santaroga  With this in mind  Dasein cautiously enters the town and quickly discovers 'Jaspers'  an additive to the food and drink commonly ingested in Santaroga that seems to imbue the consumer with greater health and an expanded mind  Those who consume it do not become psychic; instead  they are simply far more lucid than the average citizen of the U S  although there are numerous hints at a group mind operating at a subconscious level  Their newspapers are vaguely subversive with their folksy  enlightened commentary on world affairs; their dinner conversations knowledgeably reference great theories of psychology  politics  and cognitive science  Soon  Dasein is having narrow misses with perfectly plausible accidents: A boy playing with a bow and arrow releases it; the lift under his car in a garage collapses; a waitress in a diner accidentally uses insecticide rather than sugar for his coffee  Knowing that Jaspers creates exceptionally perceptive  penetrating individual minds  Dasein realizes that he has offended a communal id that feels threatened by him  As Jenny tries to convince him to settle down with her there  he wonders whether he'll live long enough to decide ,1,0,0,0,0
436,The Man Who Fell to Earth,Thomas Jerome Newton is a humanoid alien who comes to Earth seeking to construct a spaceship to ferry others from his home planet  Anthea  to Earth  Anthea is experiencing a terrible drought after many nuclear wars  and the population has dwindled to less than 300  They have hundreds of superior starships  but for not being used for over 500 years  they are unusable because of little to no fuel  They have no water  loads of food that is slowly dwindling  and feeble solar power  Like all Antheans  he is super intelligent  but he has been selected to complete this mission for his strength  due to the harsh climate and gravity of Earth compared to the cold  small Anthea  Getting to Earth via a lifeboat  Newton first lands in the state of Kentucky but quickly becomes familiarized with the environment and aspires to become an entrepreneur  Newton uses advanced technology from his home planet to patent many inventions on Earth  and rises as the head of a technology based conglomerate to incredible wealth  This wealth is needed to construct his own space vehicle program in order to ferry the rest of the Anthean population  Along the way he meets Betty Jo  a simple Kentucky woman  She falls in love with him  He does not share these feelings  but takes her  and his curious fuel technician Nathan Bryce  as his few friends while he runs his company in the shadows  Betty Jo introduces Newton to many customs of Earth culture  amongst them church going  fashion  and alcohol  However  his appetite for alcohol soon invokes much emotional instability  as he is forced to deal with intense human emotions with which Antheans are unfamiliar  His secret identity as an alien is discovered by Nathan Bryce  but Newton  aware that he has been discovered  is relieved to reveal his identity to someone for the first time  The Antheans he will ferry to Earth will flourish and hopefully make use of their superintelligence to influence Earth to peace  prosperity  and safety from the apocalypse  However  the CIA arrests Newton  having followed him since his appearance on Earth and having recorded this private conversation with Bryce  They submit him to rigorous tests and analysis  but ultimately find that  despite much conclusive evidence of his alien identity  it would be pointless to release the results because the public would not believe the truth  Such claims would also reflect poorly on the Democratic Party  responsible for the capture  The CIA releases Newton  but no sooner than he tries to exit his building  the FBI  uninformed by the CIA that Newton is exempt from further tests  commences their own brief examinations  Their final examination is ultimately an X ray of Newton skull  through his eyes  Newton  whose eyes are sensitive to X rays  tries to stop them to no avail and is blinded  The story of Newton blinding reaches the press in a frenzy and then is used by the Republican Party to depict the Democrats as being corrupt  and leads to their seizure of power  which is to inevitably lead to apocalypse  Newton  in a final confrontation with Bryce  is bitterly unable to continue his spaceship project due to planetary alignments having changed during captivity and the troubles of his blindness  He creates a recording of alien messages which he hopes to be broadcast via radio to his home ,1,0,0,0,0
437,The Quiet Earth,John Hobson  a geneticist involved in a project concerned with manipulating DNA  awakes in his hotel room in Thames  New Zealand after a nightmare of falling from a great height  His wristwatch has stopped at 6:12  Upon getting up he finds the electricity off  It is quiet outside  with nobody in sight  Hobson checks the time in his car  finding the vehicle clock is also frozen at 6:12  The town shops are locked and unattended  with no sign of people  Investigating a car sitting at an intersection  Hobson sees that the driver seatbelt is still fastened  Telephones are dead and there is only static on the radio  All humans and animals have disappeared  No watch or clock shows anything other than 6 12  Hobson concludes that some force has altered the clocks to show the same time and then stopped them  suggesting an intelligence behind the event  which Hobson dubs 'the Effect'  A garden yields the first sign of life Hobson has found ‚Äì a worm dug up from the soil  The garden is otherwise devoid of fauna  Hobson wonders if he has gone mad  but dismisses the idea  During the night  Hobson hears sounds from outside approaching  Hobson wills the entity to leave  and the sounds retreat  Uncertainty as to whether the presence was there  or whether it may have been a stray animal spared from the Effect competes in his mind with speculations that the intruder could be a manifestation of the Effect  Hobson reassures himself that he can keep the entity at bay with mental effort  The next morning Hobson procures weapons and supplies  and leaves for Auckland  finding the city deserted  Hobson seems to be the only human being remaining  He wonders what rendered him immune to the Effect  Hobson hurries to an apparent smoke signal coming from the North Shore  only to find suburban homes destroyed by the impact of a jetliner  The plane was empty when it crashed  Hobson travels to the research unit  where he worked to reactivate dormant genes in humans and animals using high frequency sound waves and radiation  The unit is head  Perrin  believed that awakening the dormant genes would lead to a quantum leap in evolution  Hobson finds Perrin in a radiation chamber  dead at the controls of the sound wave machine  The machine appears to have short circuited  but there is no evidence indicating how Perrin died  Hobson decides he perished before the Effect ‚Äì as dead animal tissue did not vanish  Hobson retrieves Perrin papers  then begins journeying to Wellington  hoping to find survivors or clues as to what happened  En route to Rotorua  Hobson sees a creature in his headlights  The monster is some kind of hybrid of dog and calf  Hobson drives off terror stricken  unsure as to whether the apparition was really there  At Rotorua  Hobson almost commits suicide  realising everyone else is dead  Hobson comes across live fish in a stream  leading him to conclude that the Effect did not penetrate water  He is startled when an electronic howling noise booms out across Lake Taupo from the far side  Hobson reaches an area of bushland near Turangi  his path blocked by a truck  Back tracking  he finds the alternate route also cut off  Trying to work around the stalled vehicle  he is confronted by another survivor with a rifle  The gunman is Apirana Maketu  a MƒÅori and a lance corporal in the New Zealand Army  Api woke up at his barracks in Waiouru to find the base deserted  He remained at his post for two days before setting out to find survivors  A search of Gisborne and the East Coast yielded nothing  and a visit to the power station at Tokaanu led him to believe the electrical grid was knocked out by a massive surge  Api heard the same sound that Hobson heard ‚Äì albeit earlier in the day and coming from the side of the lake that Hobson was standing on  Believing it to be a car  Api laid the roadblock to catch anyone coming south  Api reveals his belief that something hostile is abroad in the land  It is present only in certain places  and is stronger at night  The soldier is both relieved and worried to find that Hobson has experienced the same dread  The two men seem to already know one other  sharing a flash of recognition upon first meeting  Neither can account for this  as they have never encountered each other before  They arrive at the nation capital to find it devoid of life  Api and Hobson set up dwellings in a hotel and hunt for survivors  Hobson plans to run tests to see if he can determine the nature of the Effect and the reason why he and Api survived  Api assists Hobson with procuring equipment for the scientist studies  A radio transceiver is set up  and the duo transmit words and Morse code across the world  They receive no response  Hobson investigations reveal no reason for their exemption from the Effect  The men face the prospect that they are alone  Api goes skin diving for shellfish ‚Äì he pretends to drown as a joke  and Hobson reacts unconsciously by holding the other man head underwater  There is a moment of hostility when Api breaks free  resolved when Hobson explains that his son  who was autistic  drowned in a bathtub  and Hobson felt Api was making fun of this  The death of the child led to the end of Hobson marriage  Both men realize that Hobson is not in complete control of his actions  Visiting the Beehive  Api speculates that they could be lab rats on some kind of duplicate Earth; it is they who disappeared  Hobson puts no stock in this theory  Three weeks after the Effect  Hobson is left alone while Api goes to get a new car  Hobson goes into Api bedroom and finds photographs of Api as a private during the Vietnam War  posing with the mutilated corpses of Viet Cong  Hobson believes that Api is a psychopath  Hobson feels helpless to prevent his relationship with Api from deteriorating further and plans to kill Api with sleeping pills  After searching for a boat to take them to the South Island  during which both men experience an attack of dread from the 'force' hounding them  Api takes Hobson for a joyride in his Lotus Elite  A woman runs into the car path  She is taken to the hotel and made comfortable  but neither Api nor Hobson are medically trained  Unless she is less badly hurt than she seems  she will die  The men bicker pointlessly  The woman condition worsens  and there is nothing her fellow survivors can do for her  Hobson senses the unseen force again  emanating from the empty city  He speculates that the force may have always been a part of the land  and is claiming the Earth  Api studies the Bible  and later wakes Hobson to tell him that he has solved the clock enigma  6 12 relates to the Number of the Beast  666 (6 12 = 6 and 6 plus 6) and to Revelation 6:12  with the Biblical chapter talk of men hiding from the face of God  Hobson does not believe this  and holds a hidden gun on the deranged soldier  The woman dies  sending Api into hysterics  After another argument  a full scale battle with guns and grenades ensues  Hobson kills Api  with the soldier seeming to give up  The scientist is now alone  Breaking open Perrin box  Hobson realizes his colleagues considered him unbalanced and kept him under surveillance  Perrin believed that Hobson DNA was altered due to radiation  which caused his child autism  Hobson believes the Effect was his doing  The project he worked on caused the unraveling of animal DNA; only those with the dormant gene pair were spared  Flashbacks detail Hobson last days at the research unit  Perrin seizes upon an accident with the sound wave/radiation machine in which Hobson set the sound modulator too high and was blasted out of his chair by an invisible energy wave  Perrin charges Hobson with negligence  as the sample slides for insects and animals in the machine are blank  while the ones for plants are normal  This event cements for Hobson his long growing misgivings about the experiments  and what he believes are Perrin motives for pursuing them  In a later flashback  Hobson relates how he sabotaged the sound wave machine before going on leave to output a much higher level of infrasound than the controls would register  The idea was to put the machine out of action temporarily  ruining Perrin chance to use Hobson theories  Hobson took what he believed to be a fatal dose of sleeping pills on the night before the Effect  As he reads Perrin notes  Hobson realises that this sabotage almost certainly caused the Effect  His act always had a different purpose  to kill Perrin  Believing his boss insane and consumed with a desire to play God  Hobson subconsciously altered his own memory to hide this fact from himself  This ability to edit his own recollections  and to take refuge in a kind of mental uper reality'  is purely automatic  Hobson finally accepts the guilt for letting his son drown  Allowing his child to die was his way of destroying himself  a kind of external suicide  The child autism mirrored his father own emptiness  Perhaps Hobson caused the Effect  or is dreaming all this in a barbiturate coma  or is in Hell or Purgatory  Perhaps the rest of humanity evolved  or is unchanged and wondering where Hobson and a handful of others have gone to  With the death of the entire race on his hands  Hobson jumps from the hotel  He gathers speed  then wakes up in his motel room in Thames  Recovering from the nightmare of falling  all he can remember of the dream he was ripped from  he notices that his wrist watch has stopped at 6:12 ,1,0,0,0,0

439,The Last Continent, The story opens weeks after the events of Interesting Times  in which Rincewind is magically transported to the continent of Xxxx due to a miscalculation made by the Unseen University wizards  He meets the magical kangaroo Scrappy  who was sent by the creator of Fourecks  Scrappy explains to Rincewind that he is fated to bring back The Wet  meaning the rain  and that he is the reason for the eons long drought  Scrappy says that the continent is unfinished  and time and space will be an eternal anomaly there until it is finished  i e  the rain is brought back  Rincewind is shown cave paintings of Wizards  Meanwhile  the senior wizards (made up of Archancellor Mustrum Ridcully  the Dean  the Bursar  The Chair of Indefinite Studies  the Lecturer in Recent Runes  the Senior Wrangler  and Ponder Stibbons) of Unseen University are trying to find a cure for the Librarian magical malady  which causes him to transform into a native object  such as a book when near a library  whenever he sneezes  The wizards soon find out that the books in the Library become hostile and attack when not in the librarian care  The wizards cannot cure the Librarian without knowing his name  The Librarian  being also the archivist  destroyed any evidence of his true name since he believed the wizards would attempt to turn him human again  as he rather enjoyed his orangutan body (brought on by a magical accident years before)  The Lecturer in Recent Runes suggest they interrogate Rincewind  as he once worked closely with the Librarian and seemed to know more about him than anyone else  To find Rincewind  they have to find the continent of Xxxx  They seek out the Egregious Professor of Cruel and Unusual Geography  and find his office but no sign of the professor himself  They then find a magical window in space leading from the professor bathroom to a tropical island thousands of years in the past  Back in the present  Rincewind attempts to run away from his destiny  but in fact runs towards it  With the secret assistance of Scrappy  he eventually ends up wrongfully arrested for sheep theft and taken to Bugarup  where he is hoping to find a ship to escape on  Along the way he subsequently ends up inventing several things that are considered Australian Icons in the real world  for example beer soup(vegemite)  putting corks on a string round his hat to keep flies off (a common Australian outback hat stereotype)  as well as becoming the subject of a ballad that is hinted at being a parody of the song Waltzing Matilda when he is caught apparently stealing a sheep by a billabong A gigantic circular storm surrounding Fourecks prevents any ships from leaving  however  The people of Bugarup are enthusiastic for Rincewind  since they regard sheep thieves as folk heroes and encourage him to escape  while not actually allowing him to  He finds a hidden message on the ceiling of his holding cell  left by a previous escapee named Tinhead Ned  a reference to the famous Australian bushranger telling him to check the hinges on the door  He discovers that he is able to lift the door off its hinges and escape  The wizards become trapped when Mrs  Whitlow  the head maid  brings them their breakfast and inadvertently closes the window that leads back into the Professor study  The wizards soon encounter plants that rapidly evolve to suit their needs but (apart from Ponder) do not question the turn of events until a large dinosaur evolves into a chicken in front of their eyes  After finding a plant based boat  the wizards start to question their surroundings even more and the god of Evolution  who has been causing the events  then turns up and helps explain things a bit  He created the boat plant so that the wizards would leave him in peace  as the plants are going haywire attempting to evolve to suit the wizards' every needs  The god does not understand the purpose of the seeds and is  it turns out  unaware of the concept of sexual reproduction  After Mrs  Whitlow explains it to him  the much excited god decides to almost completely redesign the creatures on the island in order to incorporate the idea  Ponder decides to stay to help the god while the wizards load up on provisions and leave  Ponder soon catches up with them  as he discovered that the God was fixated with beetles and built the cockroach as his primary project rather than humans  The wizards then reach Fourecks and meet the Creator of Fourecks (not of the Disc) in the process of creating it by way of impressionistic cave paintings  The wizards bicker over the Creator technique and inadvertently create the duck billed platypus  The Librarian meanwhile steals the Creator bullroarer and spins it  causing the drought Rincewind is in the process of stopping  The wizards are then frozen in time for thousands of years by the stray magic left over from creating the continent  Rincewind  having escaped from gaol  invents the Peach Nellie  and then meets up with a group of female impersonators  Darleen and Letitia  and a female  Neilette  The ladies have found his Luggage  which rescues him from the Watch  In the escape  Rincewind and Neilette break into the old brewery (which was never used because all the beer kept going flat)  An earthquake (induced by the voice of the creator) causes the brewery to collapse  trapping them inside the Luggage  When they emerge  Rincewind can see the ethereal outlines of the wizards (who were trapped  frozen in time  for thirty thousand years in the brewery)  Eventually he arrives at the University of Fourecks (which has a tower that is taller on the inside than it is on the outside)  Rincewind figures out how to free the wizards  by drawing a picture of them  as the Creator did to create animals and plants in the past  The wizards attempt to find a way to bring back the rain  but are unsuccessful  As they are sitting around  Rincewind idly twirls the

440,Contact,Eleanor Ellie Arroway is the director of Project Argus  in which scores of radio telescopes in New Mexico have been dedicated to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI)  The project discovers the first confirmed communication from extraterrestrial beings  The communication is a repeating series of the first 261 prime numbers (a sequence of prime numbers is a commonly predicted first message from alien intelligence  since mathematics is considered a universal language  and it is conjectured that algorithms that produce successive prime numbers are sufficiently complicated so as to require intelligence to implement them)  Further analysis reveals that a second message is contained in polarization modulation of the signal  The second message is a retransmission of Earth first television signal broadcast powerful enough to escape the ionosphere and be received in interstellar space; in this case  Adolf Hitler opening speech at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin  A third message is discovered containing over 30 000 pages describing plans for a machine that appears to be a kind of highly advanced vehicle  with seats for five human beings  But they cannot understand the third message until they find the fourth message  a primer hidden in phase modulation  The primer allows them to translate the alien language to human language  Ultimately  a machine is successfully built and activated  transporting five passengers ‚Äì including Ellie ‚Äì through a series of wormholes to a place near the center of the Milky Way galaxy  where they meet the senders in the guise of persons significant in the lives of the travelers  whether living or dead  Some of the travelers' questions are answered by the senders  with the senders suggesting a message is contained within one of the transcendental numbers  Upon returning to Earth  the passengers discover that what seemed like many hours to them passed by in only 20 minutes on Earth  and that all their video footage has been erased  presumably by the time changing magnetic fields they were exposed to inside of the wormholes  They are left with no proof of their stories and are accused of fabrication  Therefore  though Ellie has traveled across the galaxy and actually encountered extraterrestrial beings  she cannot prove it  The government officials deduce an international conspiracy  blaming the world richest man in an attempt to perpetuate himself  embarrass the government  and get lucrative deals from the machine consortium multi trillion dollar project  The message is claimed to be a fabrication from a secret artificial man made satellite(s) that cannot be traced  because the message stopped once the machine was activated  a feat that is impossible unless one considers time travel feasible  and Ellie and other scientists are implicated  Ellie  a lifelong religious skeptic  finds herself asking the world to take a leap of faith and believe what she and the others say happened to them  She finds only one person willing to take that leap: Palmer Joss  a minister introduced early in the book  Ellie  acting upon a suggestion by the senders of the message  works on a program which computes the digits of pi to record lengths in different bases  Very far from the decimal point (1020) and in base 11  it finds that a special pattern does exist when the numbers stop varying randomly and start producing 1s and 0s in a very long string  The string length is the product of 11 prime numbers  The 1s and 0s when organized as a square of specific dimensions form a rasterized circle  The extraterrestrials suggest that this is a signature incorporated into the Universe itself  Yet the extraterrestrials are just as ignorant to its meaning as Ellie  as it could be still some sort of a statistical anomaly  They also make reference to older artifacts built from space time itself (namely the wormhole transit system) abandoned by a prior civilization  A line in the book suggests that the image is a foretaste of deeper marvels hidden even further within pi  This new pursuit becomes analogous to SETI; it is another search for meaningful signals in apparent noise ,1,0,0,0,0
441,American Gods,The central premise of the novel is that gods and mythological creatures exist because people believe in them  Immigrants to the United States brought with them dwarves  elves  leprechauns  and other spirits and gods  However  the power of these mythological beings has diminished as people beliefs wane  New gods have arisen  reflecting America obsessions with media  celebrity  technology  and drugs  among others  The book follows the adventures of ex convict Shadow  who is released from prison a few days earlier than planned due to the death of his wife  Laura  in a car accident  He discovers at the funeral that the car crashed because Laura was performing oral sex on Shadow late friend Robbie  who was driving  Even before learning of the death of Robbie  who was to give Shadow a job  Shadow has been repeatedly offered work as a bodyguard by a conman called Mr  Wednesday  Shadow accepts Mr  Wednesday offer and they both travel across America visiting Wednesday unusual colleagues and acquaintances  Gradually  it is revealed that Wednesday is an incarnation of Odin the All Father (the name Wednesday is derived from Odin  W≈çden  day)  who in his current guise is recruiting American manifestations of the Old Gods of ancient mythology  whose powers have waned as their believers have decreased in number  to participate in an epic battle against the New American Gods  manifestations of modern life and technology (for example  the Internet  media  and modern means of transport)  who are controlling a Black hat Secret Services organization (according to the goddess Eostre  these Men in Black exist because everyone knows they must exist)  Shadow wife Laura comes back in the form of a sapient animated corpse due to a special golden coin Shadow had acquired and placed on her coffin at her burial  not knowing the effect it would have  Mythological characters prominently featured in the book include Mr Wednesday (Odin)  Low Key Lyesmith (Loki Lie Smith)  Mad Sweeney (Suibhne)  Czernobog  the Zorya  the Norns  Mr Nancy (Anansi)  Easter (Eostre)  Mama Ji (Kali)  Whiskey Jack (Wisakedjak) Mr Ibis (Thoth)  Mr Jacquel (Anubis)  Horus  and Bast  In addition to the numerous figures from real world myths  a few characters from The Sandman and its spinoffs make brief cameos in the book  Other mythological characters featured in the novel are not divine  but are legendary or folk heroes  such as Johnny Appleseed and djinns  Shadow himself is implied to be the Norse god Baldr  which is confirmed in the follow up novella  Monarch of the Glen  In the Author preferred text edition  Loki tells Shadow wife Laura that when it was all over  he was going to sharpen a stick of mistletoe  go down to the ash tree and ram it between his eyes ‚Äì implying that Shadow was indeed Baldr  as mistletoe was the only thing that could harm Baldr  During a live interview and spoken word session held at UCLA on Thursday  February 4  2010  Gaiman revealed Shadow identity as Baldur Moon  in response to a fan question  The story features  in its most erotic chapter  a succubus like re invention of the Queen of Sheba  who while posing as a prostitute literally swallows a man through her sexual organs  Bilquis  as she is called here  is later killed by one of the New Gods  Sexuality as a rule plays a part in the plot and subplots; Mr  Wednesday uses his magical powers to bed several young virgins on the journey across America (And I need her  not as an end in herself  but to wake me up a little  Even King David knew that there is one easy prescription to get warm blood flowing through an old frame: take one virgin  call me in the morning ) while Shadow is seduced in his dreams by a humanoid version of Bast  Egyptian goddess of fertility  When the New Gods murder Wednesday ‚Äì thus galvanizing the Old Gods into action ‚Äì Shadow obeys Wednesday order by holding his vigil  This is accomplished by re enacting the act performed by Odin of hanging from a World Tree while pierced by a spear  Shadow eventually dies and visits the land of the dead  where he is guided by Thoth and judged by Anubis  Eostre later brings him back to life  obeying orders that she does not fully understand  During the period between life and death  Shadow learns that he is Wednesday son  conceived as part of the deity plans  He realises that Odin and Loki have been working a two man con  They orchestrated Shadow birth  his meeting of Loki in disguise as his prison cellmate Low Key Lyesmith (Loki Liesmith) and Laura death  Loki  secretly Mr  World  the leader of the New Gods  orders Odin murder so that the battle caused between the New and Old Gods will serve as a sacrifice to Odin  restoring his power  while Loki would feed on the chaos of the battle  Shadow arrives at Rock City  site of the climactic battle  just after the battle had started but in time to stop it  explaining that both sides had nothing to gain and everything to lose  with Odin and Loki the only winners  America is a bad place for Gods  Shadow tells them  and recommends they go home and make the best of what they can get  The Gods depart  Odin ghost fades  and Loki is impaled on a branch of the World Tree by Laura  who finally dies after Shadow takes the magical coin from her  In an extensive subplot  Shadow follows a clue given to him by the Hindu god Ganesha to discover that a man called Hinzelmann  who had been Shadow neighbor for a time  is a kobold who annually sacrifices children to empower himself and prevent the small town of Lakeside from succumbing to the economic decay that has claimed many similar towns  Shadow confronts Hinzelmann  who is then shot by a local policeman whose father Hinzelmann had previously killed to keep his secret  After this  Shadow attempts to reconnect with Sam Black Crow  a girl of Native American descent whom he had met several times in the past  Unnoticed by her and her girlfriend  he slips a bouquet into Sam hand and leaves  It is not clear why the two lovers do not see him  though it is possible that Shadow is inadvertently backstage  a state of existence only Gods can enter  Following the final confrontation between the gods  Shadow visits Iceland  where he meets another incarnation of Odin who was created by the belief of the original settlers of Iceland  and is therefore much closer to the Odin of mythology than Wednesday is  Shadow accuses Odin of Wednesday actions  whereupon Odin replies that He was me  yes  But I am not him  After a short talk  Shadow gives Odin Wednesday glass eye  which Odin places in a leather bag as a keepsake  Shadow performs a simple sleight of hand coin trick  which delights Odin enough that he asks for a repeat performance  Shadow then flips the golden coin towards the sun and  without waiting to see if it ever lands  walks down the hill and away ,1,0,0,0,0
442,Stardust, The Faerie Market is held every nine years on the other side of the wall dividing Faerie from our world and for which the nearby town of Wall is named  As the book begins  the market has just begun and the town filled with visitors and vendors  Dunstan Thorn rents out his cottage to a stranger in exchange for his Heart Desire in addition to a monetary payment  The next day in the market  he meets Una  a princess imprisoned by the witch called Semele  He purchases a glass snowdrop from her with a kiss  and gives the flower to his fianc√©e Daisy  That night  Dunstan meets Una in the woods and makes love to her  A month later  Dunstan marries Daisy  In February  he receives a baby in a basket‚Äîhis and Una son  Tristran Thorn  Eighteen years later  Tristran seeks the love of Victoria Forester  the town beauty  One night  while Tristran is walking her home from the shop where he works  she sees a shooting star land in Faerie  and he vows to bring it to her in exchange for a kiss  and perhaps her hand in marriage  Thinking that he will never actually do it  Victoria promises to do whatever he asks if he brings her the star  Dunstan gives Tristran the snowdrop and helps him pass the guards at the wall by alluding to his faerie heritage  Tristran enters Faerie  At Stormhold  the King of Stormhold gathers his sons to determine who will be his heir; he hurls the Power of Stormhold  a topaz that marks its bearer as the ruler of the land  into the sky  knocking that selfsame star from the sky  He then dies  and his sons leave together  Septimus departs on his own after poisoning Tertius at a nearby inn  In a small  grey house in the woods  three ancient and mighty witches known as the Lillim learn of the fallen star by reading the entrails of a dead stoat  and the eldest of the Lilim consumes their last reserves of years  later revealed to be the heart of another fallen star  to become young again  She meets a farm boy  Brevis  at a crossroads  takes his goat  and transforms him into a second goat  using the two animals to pull her small chariot  Tristran meets a small hairy man who helps him through the woods  After Tristran helps them escape deadly trees called serewood  he learns he has the ability to find any location in Faerie  Tristran is taunted by tiny faeries  who say that he is soon to face his true love scorn  The hairy man gives Tristran a new outfit  a silver chain like the one used to imprison Una  and a candle stub which allows one to travel great distances quickly while it burns  which he explains by referencing the nursery rhyme How Many Miles to Babylon   Tristran uses the candle to quickly reach the fallen star  but is surprised to find that the star is actually a young woman named Yvaine  whose leg was broken in the fall  Yvaine hurls mud at him and continuously insults him  He resolves to bring her to Victoria anyway  tying her to him with the chain  However  the candle goes out before he can return  so the two sleep for the night  The next morning  Tristran tells Yvaine about his promise to Victoria and his intention to bring Yvaine to her  Tristran makes Yvaine a simple crutch to help her walk as her broken leg hinders her movement  They arrive at a clearing where they witness a fight between a lion and a unicorn over a golden crown  Yvaine asks Tristran to help the Unicorn when the Lion was about to kill it  Tristran  remembering the old nursery rhyme  The Lion and the Unicorn  picks up the crown and gives it to the Lion  With the crown upon its head  the Lion slips away into the forest  Tristran and Yvaine spend the night at the clearing beside the wounded Unicorn  Yvaine escapes when Tristran leaves in search of food  The witch queen  on her search for the Star  encounters Madam Semele  They share a meal and Madam Semele gives witch queen meat cooked with Limbus grass  which causes anyone who tastes it to speak nothing but the truth  forcing the witch queen to reveal the true purpose of her journey  The enraged witch queen puts a curse on her  which prevents her from seeing  touching or perceiving the star in any way and causing Semele to forget their meeting the moment the witch queen leaves  On discovering that Yvaine is gone  a despondent and regretful Tristran spends the night under a tree  Tristran talks to a tree who says that Pan  the spirit of the forest  told her to help him  The tree tells Tristran that there are people looking for Yvaine and that there is a path in the forest with a carriage coming down it that Tristran can not miss  Then it gives Tristran a leaf and says to listen to it when he needs help the most  Tristran run to catch the carriage and nearly misses it but for a tree that has fallen in the carriage path  Tristran meets Primus  the driver of the carriage  and persuades him to allow Tristran to ride in the carriage  In the mountains the witch queen makes an inn to catch Yvaine who is coming her way  She turns the goat into a man  and the goat who used to be Brevis into a girl  Yvaine falls for the trap  and the witch queen is preparing to carve out her heart when Tristran and Primus  who have also been attracted by the inn  arrive  The witch queen decides to delay killing Yvaine until she had dealt with the two unwanted guests  She attempts to poison Tristran while he is tending to the horses  but the unicorn  which is also lodged in the stable  warns him just in time  He rushes back to the inn  but is too late to warn Primus  However he is able to rescue Yvaine by forming a makeshift candle from the remnants of the magical candle he had obtained earlier  burning his left hand in the process  Shortly afterwards  Septimus arrives and finds Primus' body  He sets off in search of the witch queen  in order to fulfill an obligation to avenge his slain brother  and the topaz  in order to claim his birthright as the last surviving son of Stormhold  Tristran and Yvaine escape the witch queen  but find themselves in an almost equally perilous situation  They walk past many scenes in the light of the candle  but eventually end up stranded on a cloud  miles above Faerie  Fortunately  they are rescued by the crew of a passing airborn ship  The captain of the ship agrees to help them on their way back to Wall  hinting that he is part of a mysterious 'fellowship' that wants to help Tristran for some unspecified reason  Tristran expresses regret for chaining Yvaine up  The star reveals that while Tristran no longer intends to force her to accompany her to Wall  the custom of her people dictates that  because he saved her life  she is nonetheless obliged to follow him  Upon parting company with the ship and its crew  Tristran and Yvaine encounter Madam Semele  Due to the curse the witch queen put on her  Madam Semele is unable to see Yvaine  but agrees to transport Tristran the rest of the way to Wall  as she is going there to attend the market herself  Tristran obtains a promise from Madam Semele that he will not be harmed  will receive board and lodging  and will arrive at Wall in the same manner and condition as he was on departure  However this promise does not prevent Madam Semele from transforming him into a dormouse for the duration of the journey  The star also rides on Madam Semele wagon  unbeknownst to the old woman  Septimus seeks revenge on the witch queen for killing Primus  but is himself killed by the witch queen  without ever reclaiming the topaz  Tristran (now returned to his human form)  Yvaine  Madam Semele and the witch queen all arrive at the Wall market  Tristran leaves Yvaine and crosses back into Wall  to tell Victoria that he has returned with the star  Meanwhile  Yvaine realises that she has fallen in love with Tristran and  if he fulfills his promise to bring her to Victoria  she will not only lose him to another woman  but upon leaving Faerie  will be transformed into a piece of rock  Upon meeting Tristran  a dismayed Victoria reveals that she is already engaged to Monday  Tristran old employer  and that she never believed that Tristran would fulfill his promise  She regretfully tells Tristran that she will keep her promise and marry him  However Tristran  not wishing to force Victoria to marry him points out that her promise was not to marry him  it was to give him anything he desired  and that he desires that she marry her love  Monday  Tristran returns to Yvaine at the fair  Yvaine is delighted to learn that Victoria is to be married to Monday  not Tristran  and Tristran reveals that he reciprocates Yvaine love for him  Una informs Madam Semele that she (Una) will soon be free  as her enslavement is due to end when the moon loses her child (Yvaine)  if it happens in a week when two Mondays come together (the marriage of Victoria and Monday)  The silver chain that binds Una finally fades away  and she demands payment for her services  which Madam Semele must give on pain of losing her powers  Una seeks out Tristran and Yvaine and reveals that she is Lady Una  the only daughter of the Eighty First Lord of Stormhold  and that Tristran is her son  making him the last male heir of Stormhold  She instructs Tristran to ask Yvaine for the topaz she carries  Upon receiving the topaz  the power of Stormhold passes to Tristran  However he declines to immediately return to Stormhold  leaving Lady Una to reign in his stead while he and Yvaine travel around Faerie  But before Yvainne and Tristran set off on their journey  an impossibly aged old hag turns up wishing to speak to Yvaine  She reveals herself as the witch queen  now more ancient and withered than she has ever been  Yvaine no longer fears her and tells her the good news that she has given her heart to Tristran  The witch queen claims she'd have done better to give it to the Lilim  as Tristran will only break it like all men do  She then leaves for good  fearful of the cruelty her sisters will inflict upon her for failing  Many years later  Tristran and Yvaine finally return to Stormhold  and Tristran assumes his duties as the Lord of Stormhold  When he eventually grows old and dies  Yvaine continues to reign as the immortal ruler of Stormhold ,1,0,0,0,0
443,The Sword in the Stone, The premise is that Arthur youth  not dealt with in Malory  was a time when he was tutored by Merlyn to prepare him for the use of power and royal life  Merlyn magically turns Wart into various animals at times  He also has more human adventures  at one point meeting the outlaw Robin Hood  (who is referred to in the novel as Robin Wood)  The setting is loosely based on medieval England  and in places it incorporates White considerable knowledge of medieval culture (as in relation to hunting  falconry and jousting)  However it makes no attempt at consistent historical accuracy  and incorporates some obvious anachronisms (aided by the concept that Merlyn lives backwards in time rather than forwards  unlike everyone else) ,0,1,0,0,0

448,Andromeda, This is a classic communist utopia set in a distant future  Throughout the novel  the author attention is focused on the social and cultural aspects of the society; there are several principal heroes (a historian  an archeologist  a starship captain) involved in several plot lines  Though the world shown in the novel is intended as ideal  there is an attempt to show a conflict and its resolution with a voluntary self punishment of a scientist whose reckless experiment caused damage  There is also a fair amount of action in the episodes where the crew of a starship fight alien predators  Several civilizations of our Galaxy  including Earth  are united in the Great Circle whose members exchange and relay scientific and cultural information  Notably  there is was no faster than light travel or communication in this world before events  described in novel  Moreover  interstellar missions sent by Earth are few because of very costly fuel used by interstellar (but not planetary) spaceships  and the Great Circle civilizations almost never meet in person  The Great Circle radio transmissions are pictured as taking the energy of the whole Earth and therefore infrequent; one such transmission is a lecture on the history of the Earth civilization which gives the author an opportunity to put his world into a historic context ,1,0,0,0,0
449,Ecotopia,The book is set in 1999 (25 years in the future  as seen from 1974) and consists of the diary entries and reports of William Weston  a mainstream media reporter who is the first proper American to investigate Ecotopia  a newly formed country that broke from the USA in 1980  Prior to Weston investigative reporting  most Americans had not been allowed to enter the new country  which is depicted as being on continual guard against revanchism  The new nation of Ecotopia consists of Northern California  Oregon and Washington; it is hinted that Southern California is a lost cause  The book is presented as a combination of narrative from Weston diary and dispatches that he transmits to his publication  the mythical Times Post  Together with Weston (who at the beginning is curious about  but not particularly sympathetic to the Ecotopians)  the reader learns about the Ecotopian transportation system and the preferred lifestyle that includes celebrating gender roles  official encouragement of maintaining racial separation  discouraging monogamy  promoting sexual freedom  A disdain for television and mass spectacle sports is manifested in a preference for local arts  participatory sports  and general fitness  The Ecotopians also have a peculiar ritual of (voluntary) mock warfare  fought with actual weapons and often resulting in injuries  Liberal cannabis use  as well as about decentralized and renewable energy production  green building construction  a defense strategy focused both on developing a highly advanced arms industry while also allegedly maintaining hidden WMD within major US population centers to discourage reconquest  Thorough going education reform is described  along with a highly localized system of universal medical care  (The narrator discovers that Ecotopian healing practices may include sexual stimulation ) The narrative is told through both Weston official cables back to the United States and through his diary which he keeps and later sends to his editor at the end of his assignment  In the diary we learn of observations he does not include in his columns  including his personally transformative love affair with an Ecotopian woman  These parallel narrative structures allow the reader to see how his internal reflections  as recorded in his diary  are diffracted in his external pronouncements to his readers  Despite Weston initial reservations  throughout the novel  Ecotopian citizens are characterized as clever  technologically resourceful  emotionally expressive and even occasionally violent  but also socially responsible  patriotic  They tend to live in ethnically separated localities  and they live in extended families  Their economic enterprises are entirely employee owned and  controlled  The government is dominated by a woman led but not exclusively female party  and government structures are highly decentralized  The novel concludes with Weston finding himself enchanted by Ecotopian life and deciding to stay in Ecotopia as its interpreter to the wider world ,1,0,0,0,0
450,Life  the Universe and Everything, After being stranded on pre historic Earth after the events in The Restaurant at the End of the Universe  Arthur Dent is met by his old friend Ford Prefect  who drags him into a space time eddy  represented by an anachronistic sofa  The two end up at Lord Cricket Ground two days before the Earth destruction by the Vogons  Shortly after they arrive  a squad of robots land in a spaceship in the middle of the field and attack the assembled crowd  stealing The Ashes before departing  Another spaceship  the Starship Bistromath  arrives  helmed by Slartibartfast  who discovers he is too late and requests Arthur and Ford help  As they travel to their next destination  Slartibartfast explains that he is trying to stop the robots from collecting all the components of the Wikkit Gate  Long ago  the peaceful population of the planet of Krikkit  unaware of the rest of the Universe due to a dust cloud that surrounded its solar system  were surprised to find the wreckage of a spacecraft on their planet  Reverse engineering their own vessel  they explored past the dust cloud and saw the rest of the Universe  immediately taking a disliking to it and determining it must go  They built a fleet of ships and robots to attack the rest of the Universe in a brutal onslaught known as the Krikkit Wars  but were eventually defeated  Realising that the Krikkit population would not be satisfied alongside the existence of the rest of the Universe  it was decided to envelop the system in a Slo Time envelope  allowing Krikkit to survive long after the rest of the universe has ended; the Wikkit Gate was the key to the envelope  However  just before it was activated  one ship  that had been presumably lost  carrying a troop of robots appeared and began to retrieve the pieces of the Gate after they were dispersed about space and time  The three transport to an airborne party that has lasted numerous generations where another Gate component  the Silver Bail  is to be found  but Arthur finds himself separated from the others and ends up at a Cathedral of Hate created by a being called Agrajag  Agrajag reveals that Arthur has killed him countless times before  each time reincarnating into a new form that is soon killed by Arthur  and now plans to kill Arthur in revenge  However  when he realises that Arthur has yet to cause his death at a place called Stavromula Beta  Agrajag discovered he took Arthur out of his relative timeline too soon  and that killing him now would cause a paradox but attempts to kill Arthur anyway  In his insanity  Agrajag brings the Cathedral down around them  Arthur manages to escape unharmed  partially due to learning how to fly after falling and missing the ground while catching sight of a piece of luggage he had lost at a Greek airport years before  After collecting the suitcase  Arthur inadvertently comes across the flying party and rejoins his friends  Inside  they find Trillian  but they are too late to stop the robots from stealing the Bail  Arthur  Ford  Trillian  and Slartibartfast return to the Bistromath and try to head off the robots activating the Wikkit Gate  Meanwhile  the Krikkit robots steal the last piece  the Infinite Improbability Drive core from the spaceship Heart of Gold  capturing Zaphod Beeblebrox and Marvin the Paranoid Android at the same time  The Bistromath arrives too late at the gate to stop the robots  and transport to the planet to attempt to negotiate with the Krikkit people  To their surprise  they find that the people seem to lack any desire to continue the war  and are directed to the robot and spaceship facilities in orbit about the planet  With Zaphod and Marvin help  the group is able to infiltrate the facilities and discover that the true force behind the war has been the supercomputer Hactar (Due to the obvious flaw in the idea that the people of Krikkit are simultaneously smart enough to develop their ultimate weapon  a bomb that could destroy every star in the universe  while also being stupid enough not to realise that this weapon would destroy them too)  Previously built to serve a war faring species  he was tasked to build a supernova bomb that would link the cores of every sun in the Universe together at the press of a button and cause the end of the Universe  Hactar purposely created a dud version of the weapon instead  causing his creators to pulverise him into dust  which thus became the dust cloud around Krikkit  still able to function but at a much weaker level  Trillian and Arthur speak to Hactar in a virtual space that he creates for them to explain himself  Hactar reveals that he spent eons creating the spaceship that crashed on Krikkit in order to inspire their xenophobia and incite them to go to war  also influencing their thoughts  However  when the Slo Time envelope was activated  his control on the population waned  As he struggles to remain functional  Hactar apologises to Trillian and Arthur for his actions before they leave for their ship  With the war over  the group collects the core of the Heart of Gold and the Ashes  the only two components of the Wikkit Gate not destroyed by the robots  and returns Zaphod and Marvin to the Heart of Gold  Returning only moments after the robots' attack at the Lord Cricket Grounds  Arthur attempts to return the Ashes  but is suddenly inspired to bowl one shot at a wicket that is being defended using a cricket ball in his bag  However  in mid throw  Arthur suddenly realises that the ball he had was created and placed in his bag by Hactar and is actually the working version of the cosmic supernova bomb  and that the defender of the wicket is one of the Krikkit robots  ready to detonate the bomb once thrown  all this causing him to trip  miss the ground  and allow him to fly  Arthur is able to throw the ball aside and disable the robot in mid throw  In the epilogue the characters are taking Arthur to a 'quiet and idyllic planet' when the come across a half mad journalist  He tells them that he was at a court case and a witness there was given too much of a truth drug and started to tell all truth  which was driving everybody there mad  They go to the courtroom in the hope of learning the question of Life  the Universe and everything is from him  They discover he is finished and he has forgotten it all  In the end Arthur goes to live on the planet Krikkit where he becomes a more skillful flier and learns bird language ,1,0,0,0,0
451,Pebble in the Sky,While walking down the street in Chicago  Joseph Schwartz  a retired tailor  is the unwitting victim of a nearby nuclear laboratory accident  by means of which he is instantaneously transported tens of thousands of years into the future (50 000 years  by one character estimate  a figure later retconned by future Asimov works as a mistake)  He finds himself in a place he does not recognize  and due to apparent changes in the spoken language that far into the future  he is unable to communicate with anyone  He wanders into a farm  and is taken in by the couple that lives there  They mistake him for a mentally deficient person  and they secretly offer him as a subject for an experimental procedure to increase his mental abilities  The procedure  which has killed several subjects  works in his case  and he finds that he can quickly learn to speak the current lingua franca  He also slowly realizes that the procedure has given him strong telepathic abilities  including the ability to project his thoughts to the point of killing or injuring a person  The Earth  at this time  is seen by the rest of the Galactic Empire as a rebellious planet &mdash; it has  in fact  rebelled three times in the past &mdash; and the inhabitants are widely frowned upon and discriminated against  Earth also has several large radioactive areas  although the cause is never really described  With large uninhabitable areas  it is a very poor planet  and anyone who is unable to work is legally required to be euthanized  The people of the Earth must also be executed when they reach the age of sixty  a procedure known as The Sixty  with very few exceptions; mainly for people who have made significant contributions to society  That is a problem for Schwartz  who is now sixty two years old  The Earth is part of the Trantorian Galactic Empire  with a resident Procurator  who lives in a domed town in the high Himalayas and a Galactic military garrison  but in practice it is ruled by a group of Earth centered religious fanatics who believe in the ultimate superiority of Earthlings  They have created a new  deadly supervirus that they plan to use to kill or subjugate the rest of the Empire  and to avenge themselves for the way their planet has been treated by the galaxy at large  Among other things  this virus has the ability to kill by radiation poisoning  Joseph Schwartz  along with Affret Shekt  the scientist who developed the new device that boosted Schwartz mental powers  his daughter Pola Shekt  and a visiting archaeologist Bel Arvardan  are captured by the rebels  but they escape with the help of Schwartz new mental abilities  and they are narrowly able to stop the plan to release the virus  Schwartz uses his mental abilities to provoke a pilot from the Imperial garrison into bombing the site where the arsenal of the super virus exists  The book ends on a hopeful note &mdash; perhaps the Empire can be persuaded to restore the Earth  and to bring in huge amounts of uncontaminated soil ,1,0,0,0,0
452,A Canticle for Leibowitz,A Canticle for Leibowitz opens 600 years after 20th&nbsp;century civilization has been destroyed by a global nuclear war  known as the Flame Deluge  The text reveals that as a result of the war there was a violent backlash against the culture of advanced knowledge and technology that had led to the development of nuclear weapons  During this backlash  called the Simplification  anyone of learning  and eventually anyone who could even read  was likely to be killed by rampaging mobs  who proudly took on the name of Simpletons  Illiteracy became almost universal  and books were destroyed en masse  Isaac Edward Leibowitz had been a Jewish electrical engineer working for the United States military  Surviving the war  he converted to Roman Catholicism and founded a monastic order  the Albertian Order of Leibowitz  dedicated to preserving knowledge by hiding books  smuggling them to safety (booklegging)  memorizing  and copying them  The Order abbey is located in the American southwestern desert  near the military base where Leibowitz had worked before the war  on an old road that may have been a portion of the shortest route from the Great Salt Lake to Old El Paso  Leibowitz was eventually betrayed and martyred  Later beatified by the Roman Catholic Church  he became a candidate for sainthood  Centuries after his death  the abbey is still preserving the Memorabilia  the collected writings that have survived the Flame Deluge and the Simplification  in the hope that they will help future generations reclaim forgotten science  The story is structured in three parts titled: Fiat Homo  Fiat Lux  and Fiat Voluntas Tua  The parts are separated by periods of six centuries each  In the 26th&nbsp;century  a 17 year old novice named Brother Francis Gerard is on a vigil in the desert  While searching for a rock to complete a shelter Brother Francis encounters a Wanderer  apparently looking for the abbey  who inscribes Hebrew on a rock that appears the perfect fit for the shelter  When Brother Francis removes the rock he discovers the entrance to an ancient fallout shelter containing relics  such as handwritten notes on crumbling memo pads bearing cryptic texts resembling a 20th century shopping list  He soon realizes that these notes appear to have been written by Leibowitz  his order founder  The discovery of the ancient documents causes an uproar at the monastery  as the other monks speculate that the relics once belonged to Leibowitz  Brother Francis' account of the wanderer  who ultimately never turned up at the abbey  is also greatly embellished by the other monks amid rumours that he was an apparition of Leibowitz himself; Francis strenuously denies the embellishments  but equally persistently refuses to deny that the encounter occurred  despite the lack of other witnesses  Abbot Arkos  the head of the monastery  worries that the discovery of so many potentially holy relics in such a short period may cause delays in Leibowitz canonization process  Francis is banished back to the desert to complete his vigil and defuse the sensationalism  Many years later the abbey is visited by Monsignors Aguerra (God Advocate) and Flaught (the Devil Advocate)  the Church investigators in the case for Leibowitz sainthood  Leibowitz is eventually canonized as Saint Leibowitz &ndash; based partly on the evidence Francis discovered in the shelter &ndash; and Brother Francis is sent to New Rome to represent the Order at the canonization Mass  He takes the documents found in the shelter and an illumination of one of the documents on which he has spent years working  a gift to the Pope  On route  he is robbed and his illumination taken  Francis completes the journey to New Rome and is granted an audience with the pope  Francis presents the pope with the remaining documents and the pope comforts Francis by giving him gold with which to ransom back the illumination; however  Francis is murdered during his return trip by misborn people (the Pope children)  receiving an arrow in the face  The Wanderer discovers and buries Francis body  (The book then focuses on the vultures who were denied their meal; they fly over the Great Plains and find much food near the Red River until a city state  based in Texarkana  rises)  In 3174  the Albertian Order of St  Leibowitz is still preserving the half understood knowledge from before the Flame Deluge and the subsequent Age of Simplification  The new Dark Age is ending  however  and a new Renaissance is beginning  Thon Taddeo Pfardentrott  a highly regarded secular scholar  is sent by his cousin Hannegan  Mayor of Texarkana  to the abbey  Thon Taddeo  frequently compared to Albert Einstein  is interested in the Order preserved collection of Memorabilia  At the abbey  Brother Kornhoer  a talented engineer  has just finished work on a generator of electrical essences  a treadmill powered electrical generator that powers an arc lamp  He gives credit for the generator to work done by Thon Taddeo  After arriving at the monastery  Thon Taddeo  by studying the Memorabilia  makes several major discoveries  and asks the abbot to allow the Memorabilia to be removed to Texarkana  The Abbot Dom Paulo refuses  stating he can continue his research at the abbey  Before departing  the Thon comments that it could take decades to finish analyzing the Memorabilia  Meanwhile  Hannegan makes an alliance with the kingdom of Laredo and the neighboring  relatively civilized city states against the threat of attack from the nomadic warriors  Hannegan  however  is manipulating the regional politics to effectively neutralize all of his enemies  leaving him in control of the entire region  Monsignor Apollo  the papal nuncio to Hannegan court  sends word to New Rome that Hannegan intends to attack the empire of Denver next  and that he intends to use the abbey as a base of operations from which to conduct the campaign  For his actions  Apollo is executed  and Hannegan initiates a church schism  declaring loyalty to the Pope to be punishable by death  The Church excommunicates Hannegan  It is the year 3781  and mankind has nuclear energy and weapons again  as well as starships and extra solar colonies  Two world superpowers  the Asian Coalition and the Atlantic Confederacy  have been embroiled in a cold war for 50 years  The Leibowitzan Order mission of preserving the Memorabilia has expanded to the preservation of all knowledge  Rumors that both sides are assembling nuclear weapons in space and that a nuclear weapon has been detonated increase public and international tensions  At the abbey  the current abbot  Dom Jethras Zerchi  recommends to New Rome that the Church reactivate the Quo Peregrinatur Grex Pastor Secum (Whither Wanders the Flock  the Shepherd is with Them) contingency plans involving certain vehicles the Church has had since 3756  A nuclear incident occurs in the Asian Coalition city of Itu Wan: an underground nuclear explosion has destroyed the city  and the Atlantic Confederacy counters by firing a warning shot over the South Pacific  New Rome tells Zerchi to proceed with Quo Peregrinatur and plan for departure within three days  He appoints Brother Joshua as mission leader  telling him that this is an emergency plan for perpetuating the Church on the colony planets in the event of a nuclear war on Earth  The Order Memorabilia will also accompany the mission  That night the Atlantic Confederacy launches an assault against Asian Coalition space platforms  The Asian Coalition responds by using a nuclear weapon against the Confederacy capital city of Texarkana  A ten day cease fire is issued by the World Court  Brother Joshua and the space trained monks and priests depart on a secret  chartered flight for New Rome  hoping to leave Earth on the starship before the cease fire ends  During the cease fire  the abbey offers shelter to refugees fleeing the regions affected by fallout  which results in a battle of wills over euthanasia between the abbot and a doctor from a government emergency response camp  The war resumes and a nuclear explosion occurs near the abbey  Abbot Zerchi tries to flee to safety  bringing with him the abbey ciborium containing consecrated hosts  but it is too late  He is trapped by the falling walls of the abbey and finds himself lying under tons of rock and bones as the abbey ancient crypts disgorge their contents  Among them is a skull with an arrow shaft protruding from its forehead (presumably that of Brother Francis Gerard from the first section of the book)  As he lies dying under the abbey rubble  Zerchi is startled to encounter Mrs Grales/Rachel  a bicephalous tomato peddler and mutant  However  Mrs  Grales has been rendered unconscious by the explosion  and may be dying herself  As Zerchi tries to conditionally baptize Rachel  she refuses  and instead takes the ciborium and administers the Eucharist to him  It is implied that she is  like the Virgin Mary  exempt from original sin  Zerchi soon dies  having witnessed an apparent miracle  After the Abbot death  the scene flashes to Joshua and the Quo Peregrinatur crew launching as the nuclear explosions begin  Joshua  the last crew member to board the starship  knocks the dirt from his sandals  murmuring Sic transit mundus (Thus passes the world)  As a coda  there is a final vignette depicting the ecological aspects of the war: seabirds and fish succumb to the poisonous fallout  and a shark evades death only through moving to particularly deep water  where  it is noted  the shark was very hungry that season ,1,0,0,0,0
453,Ender Shadow,Bean  the main character  is a homeless child living in the hellish streets of Rotterdam in roughly 2170 after escaping as an infant from an illegal genetic engineering laboratory  Being hyper intelligent and extremely young  Bean experiences revolve primarily around his need for food  He joins a huge gang of children led by a girl named Poke and sets up a system in which they can all receive nourishment at a local soup kitchen  The draw back on this is their increasing dependence on the bully Achilles  who is ruthless  mad  and methodical  Luckily for Bean  his incredible mind  creativity  and determination bring him to the attention of Sister Carlotta  a nun who is recruiting children to fight a war against the Buggers  At the training facility  Battle School  Bean true genius becomes apparent  Not only is he smarter than average  he is smarter than any other child at Battle School  including Ender Wiggin  Despite Bean intelligence  it is Ender who has been chosen to save humanity from the Buggers  Bean  being an extraordinary genius  begins to uncover secrets and truths about the school  Bean struggles to understand what quality Ender has that he does not  until he is assigned to draw up a hypothetical roster for Ender army  and adds himself to the list  At first  Ender does not appear to recognize Bean brilliance  but time shows that he was grooming Bean as his tactical support  putting him at the head of an unorthodox platoon challenged to outthink the teachers who designed the game  and defeat their attempts to tip the balance of advantages towards Ender rivals  Throughout the book  the main theme rests on Bean personal struggle against the IF administration  which seems bent on breaking Ender  even if it means murder  Throughout all of this  Bean has to contend with the reappearance of Achilles and his own struggle to understand what makes Ender human  He also makes friends with an older boy named Nikolai Delphiki who is drawn to Bean because of their similar looks  It is soon discovered  through Sister Carlotta research  that the two boys are actually genetic twins  except for Bean genetic enhancements  Back in the lab  the scientist Volescu had turned Anton Key  which meant that Bean body would never stop growing   including his brain   until a premature death between the ages of fifteen and twenty five  Sister Carlotta manages to ensure that Bean will get to live with Nikolai and his parents after the war  This story takes the reader through Bean experiences in Battle School and shows how he  a secondary character in Ender Game  is much more important to the fate of Earth than it originally seemed  In addition  the book depicts the first of Bean encounters with Achilles  At the very end of the story  Ender leaves on a colonization ship and never returns to Earth as part of a treaty so no countries or groups on Earth can use him  Ender Shadow is the first of a series that includes Shadow of the Hegemon  Shadow Puppets  Shadow of the Giant  and Shadows in Flight ,1,0,0,0,0
454,The Giver, The book focuses on a twelve year old boy named Jonas residing in an immaculately organized  tightly run  but strict utopian society known as the community of Sameness   where eccentricities in behavior  appearance  or personality are strongly outlawed and opposed  Nearing an age where he will be selected for the position that he will hold in the Community throughout adulthood  Jonas is selected for the role as the Receiver of Memory  the keeper of all ancient memories in the Community before the start of the strict system through which the world is now run  Under the guidance of the older Receiver of Memory  the Giver  Jonas is transferred memories that had taken place years prior to the events of the story  involving color  emotion  freedom  and pain  which have since been drained entirely from the Community  Through the Giver  Jonas receives stunning wisdom of the true secret runnings of the Community  including secrets remaining heavily guarded from its inhabitants  and the boy starts to yearn for the happier world which had been available during the past  He is exposed to shocking footage of his father  a Nurturer  injecting a baby twin with poison (as a means of living up to the Community mandatory standards of population control) and is shocked by the true intentions and behaviors of the residents in the Community  how their utter inability to accept pain forced their hunger for a Receiver of Memory  The Giver informs Jonas that it is up to him to help restore freedom to the world  and therefore he must flee the town late at night with the other closest option for a Receiver; a baby boy named Gabriel  who Jonas family had been sheltering for the past few months  so the Giver may convince everyone that they have died so they may once again accept the burden of the pains of their own memories and everything can be restored to how it had formerly been  Jonas must escape to Elsewhere  an unknown land located beyond the boundaries of the Community  and the pair must endure through the freezing cold together  just as Jonas thinks he hears singing (a reference to a past memory he'd received) ,1,0,0,0,0
455,Xenocide, The plot alternates between characters on two planets: Path and Lusitania  Lusitania is an alien planet home to a curious species known as the piggies  Following the events of Speaker for the Dead  we find a story of another set of characters living as a member of a Brazilian Catholic human colony on Lusitania  a unique planet inhabited by the only other two known species of sentient alien life: the Pequeninos little ones and the Hive Queen  The pequeninos are native to the planet  while the Hive Queen was transplanted to this world by Ender  partly in penance for his near total destruction of her Formic species in Ender Game  Unfortunately  the Lusitanian ecosystem is pervaded by a complex virus  dubbed 'Descolada' (Portuguese for no longer glued) by humans  The Descolada breaks apart and rearranges the basic genetic structure of living cells  It is incredibly adaptable to any species or form of known life  and easily transmissible  The native pequeninos and other life that survived on Lusitania after the Descolada introduction to the planet thousands (or millions) of years ago are adapted to it  As a result of the deadly virus  the Lusitanian ecosystem is severely limited  Staying alive on Lusitania takes immense effort and research on the part of the Hive Queen and the humans  as they are not adapted to the descolada  Near the end of the story  it is revealed the Descolada is possibly an artificially engineered virus designed to terraform planets  but the original creators of the virus are unknown  and there remains a slim chance it evolved naturally  After the rebellion of the small human colony on Lusitania in Speaker for the Dead to protect the future of the intelligent alien species  Starways Congress sends a fleet to Lusitania to regain control  which will take several decades to reach its destination  Valentine Wiggin  under her pseudonym Demosthenes  publishes a series of articles revealing the presence of the Little Doctor planet annihilating weapon on the Fleet  Demosthenes calls it the Second Xenocide  as using the weapon will result in the obliteration of the only known intelligent alien life  She also claims it to be a brutal crackdown of any colony world striving for autonomy from Starways Congress  Public anger spreads through humanity  and rebellions nearly ensue on several colonies  After quelling much public discontent  Starways Congress finishes their analysis of the situation while the fleet is en route  Fearing the Descolada virus  further rebellions by colony worlds  and other possible unknown political motives  Starways Congress attempts to relay an order to the fleet to annihilate Lusitania upon arrival  After conferring with friends on whether a cause is worth dying for  Jane (a compassionate AI living in the interstellar Ansible communication network) shuts off transmissions to the fleet to block the order  As a consequence of this action  she risks her eventual discovery and death  should the government shut down and wipe the interplanetary network  No known smaller computer system can house her consciousness  On Lusitania itself  Ender attempts to find solutions to the looming catastrophes of the Congressional fleet  Descolada virus  and conflicts among the humans and intelligent alien species  Much on Lusitania centers around the Ribeira family  including Ender wife Novinha  and her children  Novinha and Elanora  the mother daughter team responsible for most of the biological advances countering the complex Descolada virus  are unsure if they can manufacture a harmless replacement virus  Conflicts arise on whether they should even do so  since the Descolada is intrinsically tied in with the life cycles of all Lustitanian organisms  and may even be sentient itself  In addition  to try to devise methods to escape the planet  Lusitania leading  troublemaking physicist Grego is persuaded by Ender to research faster than light travel  despite Grego scoffing at the idea  The third biologista of the family  Quara  is convinced that the Descolada is an intelligent  self aware species  and deserves attempts from the humans for communication and preservation  An additional sibling and Catholic priest  Quim (Father Estev√£o)  is determined to use faith and theology to head off another form of xenocide: a group of warmongering Pequenino wish to wipe out all Earthborn life via starship  carrying the deadly Descolada within them  Starways Congress wants its fleet back  After all else fails  it sends the dilemma of the fleet impossible disappearance to several citizens of the world of Path  a cultural planetary enclave modeled on early China  Path culture centers on the godspoken   those who hear the voices of the gods in the form of irresistible compulsions  and are capable of significantly superior intelligence  It later becomes clear that the godspoken of Path are victims of a cruel government project: granted great intelligence by genetic modification  they were also shackled with a form of obsessive compulsive disorder to control their loyalty  The experiment is set in a culture bound by five dictates   obey the gods  honor the ancestors  love the people  serve the rulers  then serve your self  This is a further safeguard against rebellion  The superintelligent godspoken are considered the most devout and holy of all citizens  and any disloyal thoughts in a godspoken mind are immediately suppressed by overwhelming obsessive compulsive behavior  believed to be a sign from the gods the thoughts are wrong  The most respected godspoken on Path is Han Fei Tzu  for devising a treaty to prevent the rebellion of several colony worlds after the articles published by Demosthenes  Great things are expected of his daughter and potential successor Han Qing jao  Gloriously Bright  While doubting the existence of the gods himself  Han Fei Tzu promised his dying wife he would raise Qing jao with an unwavering belief in the godspoken  The two of them are tasked by Starways Congress with deciphering the disappearance of the Lusitania Fleet  Han Qing jao secret maid  Si Wang mu  aids her in this task  her intelligence (partially) unfettered by the rigid caste system  The young and naive Qing jao eventually traces the identity of Demosthenes  Discovering that Demosthenes is Valentine Wiggin  Ender sister ‚Äì but that Valentine has been on a starship en route to Lusitania for the last thirty years ‚Äì Qing Jao concludes that the only possible explanation is advanced computer software closely tied to the communication network  This software must be hiding Demosthenes and publishing her work  while also causing the disappearance of the Fleet  All but discovered  Jane reveals herself to Han Fei tzu  Han Qing jao and Si Wang mu  telling them about their genetic slavery and begging forbearance on their report to Starways Congress  Already harboring suspicions about the godspoken condition  Han Fei tzu accepts the news of Congress atrocity  as does Si Wang mu  but his daughter Han Qing jao clings to her belief that Demosthenes and Jane are enemies of the gods  Feeling betrayed by her father  who is violently incapacitated by OCD from the disloyal thoughts  Qing jao argues with Jane  Jane threatens shutting off all communications from Path  but Si Wang mu realizes this would eventually lead to the planet destruction by Starways Congress  Understanding Jane to be truly alive and compassionate  through tears Si Wang mu states Jane will not block the report  However  Qing jao compares Jane to the servants in Path caste system  merely a computer program designed to serve humans  containing neither autonomy nor awareness  Knowing she has exhausted her last possibilities of stopping Qing jao  Jane sacrifices her future and life  unwilling to bring harm to Qing jao or the people of Path  A triumphant Qing jao reports the knowledge of Demosthenes  Jane  and the fate of the Fleet to Starways Congress  Qing jao recommends a coordinated date set several months from the present  to prepare the massive undertaking of setting up clean computers across the interplanetary network  after which the transition to a new system will kill Jane and allow Congress full control again  Allowing the message to be sent  Jane restores communication with the Fleet  and Congress re issues the order for the Fleet to obliterate Lusitania  Han Fei tzu recovers from the incapacitation of his OCD  despairing over his daughter actions  and his unwitting aid in deeply brainwashing her to serve Congress  He and Si Wang mu assist Jane and those on Lusitania in finding solutions to their impending catastrophes  Planter  a Pequenino on Lusitania  offers his life for an experiment to determine whether the Descolada gives Pequeninos sentience  or if they have the ability innately  Eventually  Elanora Ribeira is able to come up with a possible model for a recolada: a refit of the Descolada that allows the native life to survive and retain self awareness  but does not seek to kill all other life forms  With the available equipment  however  the recolada is impossible to make  and they are running out of time against the soon to arrive Fleet  While this research takes place  tragedies occur on Lusitania  Father Estev√£o Ribeira  the priest attempting to sway a distant warmongering sect of the Pequeninos from their goal of attacking humanity  is killed  Grego Ribeira spurs a riot of humans to burn down the warmonger forest  but the violent mob gets out of his control  and rampages through the neighboring Pequenino forest instead  massacring many of its inhabitants ‚Äì the original friends and allies of humanity  Under the terms of the treaty with Pequeninos  the Hive Queen is brought in to hold the peace  setting a perimeter guard of hive drones around the human colony and preventing further escalation of violence between the two groups  Grego is locked in jail  despite eventually stepping between the surviving Pequeninos and his own riot  The town realizes their horrific rage  and constructs a chapel surrounding the fallen priest grave  trying to find penance for their actions  Finally   a breakthrough is made  Knowing the Ansible communication network allows instantaneous transfer of information  and through knowledge of how the Hive Queen gives sentience to child queens  Jane  Grego  and Olhado discover the Outside  The Outside is a spacetime plane where ai√∫as initially exist  (Ai√∫a is the term given to the pattern

457,It Can not Happen Here,Senator Berzelius Buzz Windrip  a charismatic and power hungry politician  is elected President of the United States on a populist platform  promising to restore the country to prosperity and greatness  and promising each citizen $5 000 a year (approximately $  adjusted for inflation)  Portraying himself as a champion of traditional American values  Windrip easily defeats his opponents  Senator Walt Trowbridge and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt  Though having previously stated that some authoritarian measures would need to be put in effect in order to reorganize the United States government  Windrip goes so far as to outlaw dissent  incarcerate political enemies in concentration camps  create a paramilitary force  called the Minute Men  who terrorize citizens and enforce the policies of Windrip and his corporatist regime  One of his first acts as President is to eliminate the influence of the United States Congress  which draws the ire of many citizens as well as the legislators themselves  The Minute Men respond to protests against Windrip decisions harshly  attacking demonstrators with bayonets  In addition to these actions  Windrip administration  known as the Corpo government  curtails women and minority rights  and eliminates individual states by subdividing the country into administrative sectors  The government of these sectors is managed by Corpo authorities  usually prominent businessmen or Minute Men officers  Those accused of crimes against the government are tried in kangaroo courts presided over by military judges  Despite these dictatorial measures  a majority of Americans approve of them  believing them to be necessary though painful steps to restore American power  Others  those less enthusiastic about the prospect of corporatism  reassure themselves that fascism cannot happen here; hence the novel title  Open opponents of Windrip  led by Senator Trowbridge  form an organization called the New Underground  helping dissidents escape to Canada in manners reminiscent of the Underground Railroad and distributing anti Windrip propaganda  Among the members of the New Underground is Doremus Jessup  the novel protagonist  a traditional liberal and an opponent of both Corpoism and communist theories  which are suppressed by Windrip administration  Jessup participation in the organization results in the publication of a periodical called The Vermont Vigilance  in which he writes editorials decrying Windrip abuses of power  Shad Ledue  the local district commissioner and Jessup former hired man  resents his old employer and eventually discovers his actions  having him sent to a concentration camp  Ledue subsequently terrorizes Jessup family and particularly his daughter Sissy  whom he unsuccessfully attempts to seduce  Sissy does  however  discover evidence of corrupt dealings on the part of Ledue  which she exposes to Francis Tasbrough  a onetime friend of Jessup and Ledue superior  Tasbrough has Ledue imprisoned in the same camp as Jessup  where he is murdered by inmates he had sent there  Jessup escapes after a relatively brief incarceration  when his friends bribe one of the camp guards  He flees to Canada  where he rejoins the New Underground  He later serves the organization as a spy in the northeastern United States  passing along information and urging locals to resist Windrip  In time  Windrip hold on power weakens  as the economic prosperity he promised does not materialize and increased numbers of disillusioned Americans  including Vice President Perley Beecroft  flee to Canada  He also angers his Secretary of State  Lee Sarason  who had served earlier as his chief political operative and adviser  Sarason and Windrip other lieutenants  including General Dewey Haik  seize power and exile the President to France  Sarason succeeds Windrip  but his extravagant and relatively weak rule creates a power vacuum in which Haik and others vie for power  In a bloody putsch  Haik leads a party of military supporters into the White House  kills Sarason and his associates  and proclaims himself President  The two coups cause a slow erosion of Corpo power  and Haik government desperately tries to arouse patriotism by launching an unjustified invasion of Mexico  After slandering Mexico in state run newspapers  Haik orders a mass conscription of young American men for the invasion of that country  infuriating many who had until then been staunch Corpo loyalists  Riots and rebellions break out across the country  with many realizing that they have been misled by the Corpos  General Emmanuel Coon  among Haik senior officers  defects to the opposition with a large portion of his army  giving strength to the resistance movement  Though Haik remains in control of much of the country  civil war soon breaks out as the resistance tries to consolidate its grasp on the Midwest  The novel ends after the beginning of the conflict  with Jessup working as an agent for the New Underground in Corpo occupied portions of southern Minnesota ,1,0,0,0,0

461,That Hideous Strength, Young academic Mark Studdock has just risen to the position of Senior Fellow in sociology at Bracton College in the University of Edgestow  just when it is engaged in selling off a portion of its land  Bragdon Wood  to a new scientific Institute the NICE (National Institute for Co ordinated Experiments) whose personnel already includes staff of the college  The sale is agreed to but the college Warden wants to back out of the deal  The sub warden  Curry  Mark Studdock and some NICE insiders have a dinner together to decide how to keep the deal alive  Curry is proud of having brought the NICE to Edgestow believing it to mark the beginning of the really scientific era  There is discussion of Mark being employed as a sociologist at the NICE  initiated by Lord Feverstone  Meanwhile Mark wife  Jane  who is also a scholar  has been having peculiar nightmares that trouble her  one in particular involving a severed head  She meets the wife of an old tutor from her recent graduate student days  Mrs  Dimble  who is being evicted from her property due to sale of land to the NICE  When Jane talks about her dreams  Dimble leads her to seek counsel with a Miss Ironwood who lives in a mansion in the nearby town of St  Anne  Mark spends an evening getting acquainted with the top brass at the NICE at their current headquarters in Belbury  He has great difficulty trying to figure out the exact nature of the job they want him to do  The lines of authority seem poorly defined  while at the same time the NICE is convinced the future of the human race depends on their success  Mark meets a scientist named Bill Hingest who is both with Bracton College and the NICE but is resigning the latter and warns Mark to get out as soon as possible  At the same time  Jane finally works up the courage to visit Miss Ironwood at St  Anne  She is greeted by Camilla Denniston  the spouse of the man who almost got Mark appointment instead of him  She says they have been expecting Jane at St  Anne  She leads her through the large house to meet Miss Ironwood  She is dressed just as Jane had dreamed of her  She is convinced that Jane dreams are visions of genuine events  When Jane returns  she discovers that her maid  Ivy Maggs  has also been evicted from her dwelling by the NICE  and has gone to live at the Manor at St  Anne with the Dimbles  Mark is given the task of writing propaganda to support NICE plan for the demolition of a scenic village called Cure Hardy so that a river can be diverted through its original location  This will be rationalized by presenting natural settings as unsanitary and by a philosophy of liquidation of anachronisms such as the backward labourer or the wastefully supported pauper  Mark journeys to Cure Hardy to write the report that will justify the demolition  During this time  he discovers that the man who resigned from the NICE  Hingest  has been mysteriously murdered shortly after departing the headquarters  The next morning he returns to NICE determined to find out the exact nature of his work and to whom he is supposed to be reporting  His official boss  Steele  seems to have no idea what is going on  Mark demands to see the Deputy Director but is put off  He runs into the head of the NICE private police force  a mannish woman named Fairy Hardcastle  who insists he must not worry about this sort of thing  and that the NICE is not run along conventional bureaucratic lines  In a later interview with the Deputy Director  John Wither  he is told that elasticity is the cornerstone of the Institute  and that they have no watertight compartments  Fog comes in on the towns of Edgestow and Belbury while there is an increase in violent incidents in the town  many apparently engineered by the NICE  Jane develops further personal ties to the group in the mansion at St  Anne  She is introduced to Dr  Elwin Ransom who is the protagonist of the first two books in Lewis' space trilogy  He has previously traveled to Mars and Venus  both of which are unaffected by the Biblical Fall of Man  He is now the legitimate king or Pendragon of the nation of Logres  the legitimate heir of King Arthur  Also living at St  Anne is a Mr  MacPhee who is politely skeptical of Ransom claims  At Belbury Mark has a conversation with the Italian physiologist Dr  Filostrato  He admires the purity of the moon given that it has no organic life  He declares that underground is a race that has almost broken free of the organic  free of Nature  Mark is then introduced to the Head of the NICE  They have preserved the head of a recently executed scientist and restored the head to life with artificial scientific devices  where blood and air are pumped through it  It becomes clear that the NICE is engineering the creation of a new species relatively free of the organic  Meanwhile the NICE police have completely taken over the entire town of Edgestow  and have attempted to arrest Jane  Jane tells the group at St  Anne that she has had dreams of a place in which the NICE have been digging up the grave of a long buried man  Believing they know the actual place  the company of St  Anne travel there  They believe the NICE is looking for the body of the magician Merlin  who was buried but not actually dead  It is revealed that the NICE are mainly interested in Jane  for her psychic abilities  and are afraid of her getting into the wrong hands  Mark  now trying to leave the NICE  is arrested in Edgestow on trumped up charges of the murder of Bill Hingest  and is brought back to NICE headquarters at Belbury  though he does not originally realize that is where he is  When he does  it becomes clear to him the NICE killed Hingest as well  On a stormy night  both the company of St  Anne and Belbury personnel are on the trail of Merlin who has apparently revived  He has taken the clothes of a tramp through his powers of hypnosis  and gotten hold of a wild horse  He meets the company of St  Anne  but rides away  Members of the NICE locate the tramp and mistakenly believe him to be Merlin  Merlin arrives at St  Anne on his own  Ransom reveals that there are Satanic forces behind the NICE  He further reveals that Merlin is to be possessed by the angelic powers called eldils that guide each of the planets of the solar system  Until now Earth had been under a quarantine with a rule that the dark demonic forces that govern Earth could not travel beyond the orbit of the moon  and the angelic powers ruling the rest of the solar system could not come to Earth  However  since the forces of darkness broke the lunar barrier in the events of the earlier books  it is now possible for the good angelic forces to come to Earth  At St  Anne  Jane Studdock has two very powerful mystical experiences  the first with the earth bound counterpart of the ruling angel of Venus  and the second with God  This occurs at the same time that Mark at NICE is being initiated by Professor Frost into a dark ritual meant to cultivate absolute objectivity by killing human emotion relegated to the status of a mere chemical phenomenon  The angelic spirits that possess Merlin are guardians of each of the planets of the solar system and correspond to some gods and goddesses of Greek mythology  Merlin then disguises himself as a Basque priest and answers an advertisement put out by the NICE as an interpreter of ancient languages  Later  he is brought to interview the tramp who the NICE still believe may be the real Merlin  Both Merlin and the tramp are brought to attend a celebratory dinner put on by the NICE in honor of the public head of NICE  a science popularizer named Horace Jules  At that dinner  Merlin pronounces upon them the same curse that was placed on the Tower of Babel  causing all present to speak unintelligible gibberish  There are also massive earthquakes which ruin the building as well as much of the town of Edgestow  and cause the deaths of most of the NICE personnel and the liberation of many caged animals upon whom they were conducting experiments  Many of the animals make their way back to St  Anne  The angel of Venus now lingers as Ransom is now meant to be transported back to that planet  known to the rest of the solar system as Perelandra  The presence of Venus puts many of the animals who are there into an amorous mood  Mark  who escaped the massacre at NICE  arrives on his own at St  Anne and sees a vision of Venus  who leads him into a new bridal chamber that Jane has been preparing for him  The couple are re united

462,The Legacy of Heorot,Two hundred colonists arrive on Avalon to found a new community  having made the 100 year journey from Earth in suspended animation on the starship Geographic (the expedition is funded by the National Geographic Society)  The colonists  all selected for their outstanding physical and mental attributes  make a terrible discovery: though the suspended animation technology permitted them to survive the journey worked well enough  it had unforeseeable side effects due to the unprecedented duration of its use  Their intelligence and reasoning skill are damaged  Some are only mildly afflicted  while others have mental retardation; eight cannot be reanimated at all  The book opens with the colonists learning how to live without the sharp and nimble minds they all once had  The colonists build a town on the island of Camelot and begin growing crops and stocking the nearby waters with terrestrial species of fish to complement the samlon  a local aquatic species  The island seems like a paradise  and the colonists quickly become overconfident in their security  much to the frustration of the expedition security officer (and only former soldier)  Cadmann Weyland  But then unsettling events begin to happen: missing animals  fences torn down  etc  The colonists' impaired minds prevent them from properly analysing what is going on  and in a panic Cadmann is blamed  accused of deliberate sabotage to further his agenda  When a baby and its mother are killed while Cadmann and his only supporter are away on a hunt for the creature he believes is the cause  the colonists become increasingly irrational  When he returns alone (His companion having been killed during the hunt)  badly wounded  and with a chunk of burnt tissue he claims is from the monster  he is drugged and restrained  Then the creature (named by the colonists as a grendel after the character in the poem Beowulf) attacks the camp in revenge  Despite the colonists' advanced weapons and larger numbers  ten people are killed just to drive the grendel away  This proves to all the colonists that there is a deadly and efficient predator native to the island  Cadmann  however  is now completely unwilling to assist the community  He leaves the colony to set up a homestead on a bluff further up the mountain that forms the basis of the island  living apart from the community in despair  A woman joins him in the hopes of persuading him to return  but she stays with him and eventually conceives his child  As a result  has an epiphany: the colonists may have brutalized and betrayed him  but their children are innocent  and deserve to be protected; he returns to assist the colony  The colonists are confounded by the ecology of the island  as there does not seem to be a sufficient food source for the grendels to inhabit it  The colonists  using new weapons and Cadmann tactics  are able to kill their first grendel  The autopsy reveals that grendels are crocodilian in appearance and behavior  with jaws that can crush steel  Their bones are significantly stronger than those of humans  as they are not based on calcium  They have a sense of smell better than a dogs  Studying its brain shows it is not fully sapient  but that it is not far off  and is at least as smart as a gorilla  Its claws are not just weapons  but exert enough traction for the creature to sprint up rocky cliffs  Though it is not a true amphibian   it cannot breathe water   it does possess an integral snorkel enabling it to move undetected beneath several feet of water  Its cardiovascular system and musculature give it strength and stamina far beyond that of humans  and that is without its primary evolutionary advantage: A super oxygenated blood supplement  A grendel can  on demand  release a chemical supercharger into its blood that does to it what nitrous oxide does to internal combustion engines   enable short bursts of speed in excess of a hundred miles per hour  This trait makes the grendels dangerous  but also the key to their destruction  The supercharger  when used  generates large amounts of waste heat that warm up grendel bodies so rapidly they will die after using it if they do not immediately return to water to cool off  With this knowledge and their technology and tactics  the colonists are able to wipe out the grendel population within several months  making Cadmann a hero to the people who previously turned on him  However  the colonists make a disturbing discovery: the grendels and the aquatic samlon are actually the same species  Their life cycle is similar to that of terrestrial frogs   the herbivorous samlon are in fact the juvenile form of the carnivorous grendels  Like certain species of frogs  they change gender over the course of their lifetimes  The juvenile samlon are male  The adult grendels are female  Interaction is unnecessary as the grendels continually lay their unfertilized eggs in the water for the samlon to fertilize  And like many species of grendels  they are cannibalistic   if no other prey is present  they will eat their own young  At some point in the recent past  most of the prey animals on the island were destroyed by an unknown cataclysmic event  (It is left to the reader to draw conclusions as to what actually happened  Over predation by the grendels is subtly suggested)  Among the few surviving species on the island were the samlon  and thus the grendels  Cannibalism became the rule instead of the exception  Only the fastest juvenile samlon survived predation by grendel females to become adult grendels themselves  and this drove the species to evolve at an immensely accelerated rate  This resulted in the incredible predatory abilities of the grendels  When the colonists introduced terrestrial fish into the ecosystem  they provided the grendels with an additional food source  leading to a spike in adult grendel population/ This is why the attacks began in the first place  The colonists have just exterminated the adult grendels  There is now no check at all on the samlon population  Within a very short period of time  they all become grendels  Instead of a few dozen grendels  there are now thousands  Cadmann again asserts control  The grendels cannot hunt away from water  so the colony pregnant women  children and essential specialists are evacuated to the Geographic  Combat is joined  At first  the colonists' technology and tactics serve them well  The laser based welding tools and plasma based drilling equipment are used as weapons  Whatever liquid hydrogen can be spared from the shuttles is used to fight the grendels as well  Cadmann observes mass grendel behavior and discovers that packs of grendels can be sent into a shark like feeding frenzy by spraying them with blood taken from dead grendels  especially if it is laced with traces of the supercharger chemical extracted from the organ that secretes it  as this chemical triggers an immediate fight instinct  Tracer bullets are also used to ignite the supercharger gland in their bodies  The colonists ultimately discover and utilize a new tactic   they harvest supercharger from dead grendels and spray it over the grendel horde with crop dusting equipment  driving hundreds of them into a frenzy and killing many of those remaining  But as the grendels' numbers fall  their individual strength rises   every dead grendel is food for the rest  Eventually  all that remain are full grown grendels  and the colonists make a planned retreat to Cadmann Bluff  Cadmann carefully designed mountain hideaway which has been well stocked and reinforced with defenses  As the horde approaches  they are sprayed with more supercharger  sending them into a frenzy once more  When they begin climbing the Bluff  Cadmann sets off an avalanche using deadfall  killing even more  The grendels  though not as smart as humans  are smart enough to learn  given time and lots of experience  Their behavior changes as they realize the remaining colonists are not worth dying to reach when there are other grendels to kill  The colony is saved  A year later  the grendels are being driven to extinction  Now that the grendel life cycle is known  the colonists continue the hunts  but this time the samlon are targeted as well  New tactics   supercharger spraying and recorded grendel challenges   make them almost a chore  The terrestrial fish are gone  and will not be reintroduced  forcing the grendels to drive their own species into extinction  Soon the grendel threat will be eradicated  Now rebuilding can begin  and this time  the colonists will not be caught unaware  The mainland is being carefully explored  and the colonists have high hopes  Communications with Earth were cut off by the Grendel Wars  Now that it is over  the colonists hope the story of their battle will inspire Earth population to restart the colonization program ,1,0,0,0,0

466,Planet of the Apes,The main events of the book are placed in a frame story  in which Jinn and Phyllis  a couple out on a pleasure cruise in a spaceship  find a message in a bottle floating in space  The message inside the bottle is the testimony of a man  Ulysse M√©rou  Ulysse explains that he was a friend of Professor Antelle  a genius scientist on Earth  who invented a spaceship that could travel at nearly the speed of light  In 2500  Ulysse  the professor  and a physicist named Arthur Levain flew off in this ship to explore outer space  They traveled to the nearest star system that the professor theorized might be capable of life  the red sun Betelgeuse  which would take them about 350 years to reach  Because of time dilation  however  the trip seems to the travelers only to last two years  They arrive at the distant planetary system and find that it contains an Earth like planet  which they name Soror (Latin for sister)  They land and discover that they can breathe the air  drink the water  and eat the local vegetation  They get out and go swim in a lake  until they see a young woman on a cliff  The young woman is frightened by their traveling companion  a young chimpanzee named Hector  and so she kills him  They encounter other human beings on the planet as well  although these others act as primitively as chimpanzees and destroy the clothing of the three astronauts  They are captured by the primitive humans and stay with them for a few hours  At the end of this time  they are startled to see a hunting party in the forest  consisting of gorillas and chimpanzees using guns and machines  The apes wear human clothing identical to that of 20th century Earth  except that they wear gloves instead of shoes on their prehensile feet  The hunting party shoots several of the humans for sport  including Levain  and capture others  including Ulysse  Ulysse is taken to the apes' city  which looks exactly the same as a human city from 20th century Earth  except that some smaller furniture exists for the use of the chimpanzees  While most of the humans captured by the hunting party are sold for manual labor  Ulysse is sent to a research facility  There  the apes perform experiments on the humans similar to Pavlov conditioning experiments on dogs  and Ulysse proves his intelligence by failing to be conditioned  and by speaking and drawing geometrical figures  Ulysse is adopted by one of the researchers  Zira  a female chimpanzee  who teaches him the apes' language  He learns from her all about the ape planet  Eventually  he is freed from his cage  and meets Zira fianc√©  Corn√©lius  a respected young scientist  With Corn√©lius' help  he makes a speech in front of the ape President and numerous representatives  who grant him his liberty and is given specially tailored clothing  It is around this time that he discovers his companion Professor Antelle survived the hunt and was captured  being sent to the zoo and kept in captivity in a large cage with the primitive humans  However when the protagonist attempts to make contact and speak with the professor  it is revealed he has completely lost his mind and his faculties  degenerated and behaving just as the primitive humans do  Ulysse tours the city and learns about the apes' civilization and history  The apes have a very ancient society  but their origins are lost in time  Their technology and culture have progressed slowly through the centuries because each generation  for the most part  imitates those of the past  The society is divided between the violent gorillas  the pedantic and conservative orangutans  and the intellectual chimpanzees  Although Ulysse patrons Zira and Corn√©lius are convinced of his intelligence  the society leading orangutan scientists believe he is faking his understanding of language  because their philosophy will not allow the possibility of intelligent human beings  Ulysse falls in love with a primitive human female  Nova  whom he had met in the forest at the beginning of his visit to the planet  He impregnates her and thus proves that he is the same species as the primitive humans  which lowers his standing in the eyes of many of the apes  Their derision turns to fear with a discovery in a distant archaeological dig and an analysis of memory in some human brains  Evidence is uncovered that fills in the missing history of the apes  In the distant past  the planet was ruled by human beings who built a technological society and enslaved apes to perform their manual labor  Over time the humans became more and more dependent upon the apes  until eventually they became so lazy and degenerate that they were overthrown by their ape servants and fell into the primitive state in which our protagonist found them  While some of the apes reject this evidence  others (in particular  an old orangutan scientist  Dr  Zaius) take it as a sign that the humans are a threat and must be exterminated  Ulysse learns of this  and escapes from the planet with his wife and newborn son (Sirius)  returning to Earth in the professor spaceship  Ulysse lands on Earth more than 700 years after he had originally left it  just outside the city of Paris  Once outside the ship  he discovers that Earth is now ruled by intelligent apes just like the planet from which he has fled  He immediately leaves Earth in his ship  writes his story  places it in a bottle  and launches it into space for someone to find  It is at this point in the story that Jinn and Phyllis  the couple who found the bottle  are revealed to be chimpanzees  Jinn and Phyllis dismiss Ulysse narrative  saying that a human would not have the intelligence to write such a story ,1,0,0,0,0
467,The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde,In London  Gabriel John Utterson  a prosecutor  is on his weekly walk with his relative Richard Enfield  who proceeds to tell him of an encounter he had seen some months ago while coming home late at night from Cavendish Place  The tale describes a sinister figure named Mr  Hyde who tramples a young girl  disappears into a door on the street  and re emerges to pay off her relatives with 10 pounds in gold and a cheque signed by respectable gentleman Dr  Henry Jekyll (a client and friend of Utterson) for 90 pounds  Jekyll having recently and suddenly changed his will to make Hyde beneficiary  Utterson is disturbed and concerned about this development  and makes an effort to seek out Hyde  This is instilled by Utterson fear that Hyde is blackmailing Dr  Henry Jekyll for his money  Upon finally managing to encounter Hyde  Utterson is amazed by how ugly the man seems  as if deformed; though Utterson cannot say why exactly how this is so or why it is  Hyde seems to provoke an instinctive feeling of revulsion in him  Much to Utterson surprise  Hyde willingly offers Utterson his address  After one of Jekyll dinner parties  Utterson stays behind to discuss the matter of Hyde with Jekyll  Utterson notices Jekyll turning pale  yet he assures Utterson that everything involving Hyde is in order and to be left alone  A year passes uneventfully  One night  a servant girl witnesses Hyde beat a man to death with a heavy cane  The man is MP Sir Danvers Carew who was also a client of Utterson  The police contact Utterson  who suspects Hyde of the murder  He leads the officers to Hyde apartment  feeling a sense of foreboding amid the eerie weather (the morning is dark and wreathed in fog)  When they arrive at the apartment  the murderer has vanished  but they find half of the cane (described as being made of a strong wood but broken due to the beating) left behind a door  It is revealed to have been given to Jekyll by Utterson  Shortly thereafter  Utterson again visits Jekyll  who now claims to have ended all relations with Hyde  Jekyll shows Utterson a note  allegedly written to Jekyll by Hyde  apologizing for the trouble he has caused him and saying goodbye  That night  however  Utterson clerk points out that Hyde handwriting bears a remarkable similarity to Jekyll own  For a few months  Jekyll reverts to his former friendly and sociable manner  as if a weight has been lifted from his shoulders  Later  Jekyll suddenly begins to refuse visitors  and Dr Hastie Lanyon  a mutual acquaintance of Jekyll and Utterson  dies suddenly of shock after receiving information relating to Jekyll  Before his death  Lanyon gives Utterson a letter  with instructions that he not open it until after Jekyll death or disappearance  Utterson goes out walking with Enfield  and they see Jekyll at a window of his laboratory; the three men begin to converse  but a look of horror suddenly comes over Jekyll face  and he slams the window and disappears  Soon afterward  Jekyll butler Mr  Poole visits Utterson in a state of desperation and explains that Jekyll has secluded himself in his laboratory for several weeks  Utterson and Poole travel to Jekyll house through empty  windswept  sinister streets; once there  they find the servants huddled together in fear  They go to see the laboratory where they hear that the voice coming from inside is not the voice of Jekyll and the footsteps are light not the heavy footsteps of the Doctor  After arguing for a time  the two of them resolve to break into Jekyll laboratory  Inside  they find the body of Hyde wearing Jekyll clothes and apparently dead from suicide  They find also a letter from Jekyll to Utterson promising to explain the entire mystery  Utterson takes the document home  where first he reads Lanyon‚Äôs letter and then Jekyll  The first reveals that Lanyon‚Äôs deterioration and eventual death were caused by the shock of seeing Mr  Hyde drink a serum  or potion  and as a result of doing so  metamorphose into Dr Jekyll  The second letter explains that Jekyll  seeking to separate his good side from his darker impulses  discovered a way to transform himself periodically into a creature free of conscience  this being Mr Hyde  The transformation was incomplete  however  in that it created a second  evil identity  but did not make the first identity purely good  At first  Jekyll reports  he delighted in becoming Hyde and rejoiced in the moral freedom that the creature possessed  Eventually  however  he found that he was turning into Hyde involuntarily in his sleep  even without taking the potion  At this point  Jekyll resolved to cease becoming Hyde  One night  however  the urge gripped him too strongly  and after the transformation he immediately rushed out and violently killed Sir Danvers Carew  Horrified  Jekyll tried more adamantly to stop the transformations  and for a time he proved successful by engaging in philanthropic work  At a park  he considers how good a person he has become as a result of his deeds (in comparison to others)  believing himself redeemed  However  before he completes his line of thought  he looks down at his hands and realizes that he has suddenly once again become Mr Hyde  This was the first time that an involuntary metamorphosis had happened in waking hours  Far from his laboratory and hunted by the police as a murderer  Hyde needed Lanyon help to get his potions and become Jekyll again; when he undertook the transformation in Lanyon presence  the shock of the sight instigated Lanyon deterioration and death  Meanwhile  Jekyll returned to his home  only to find himself ever more helpless and trapped as the transformations increased in frequency and necessitated even larger doses of potion in order to reverse themselves  It was the onset of one of these spontaneous metamorphoses that caused Jekyll to slam his laboratory window shut in the middle of his conversation with Enfield and Utterson  Eventually  the stock of ingredients from which Jekyll has been preparing the potion ran low  and subsequent batches prepared by Jekyll from renewed stocks of the ingredients failed to produce the transformation effected by the original potion  Jekyll speculates that the one essential ingredient that made the original potion work must have been a trace contaminant that was absent from the ingredients he had subsequently purchased  He assumes that subsequent supplies all lacked the essential ingredient that made the potion successful for his experiments  His ability to change back from Hyde into Jekyll has slowly vanished in consequence  Jekyll writes that even as he composes his letter he knows that he will soon become Hyde permanently  and he wonders if Hyde will face execution for his crimes or choose to kill himself  Jekyll notes that  in either case  the end of his letter marks the end of the life of Dr Jekyll  He ends the letter saying I bring the life of that unhappy Henry Jekyll to an end  With these words  both the document and the novel come to a close ,1,0,0,0,0

469,The Invincible,A very powerful and armed interstellar space ship called Invincible lands on the planet Regis III which seems uninhabited and bleak  to investigate the loss of its sister ship  Condor  During the investigation  the crew finds evidence of a form of quasi life  born through evolution of autonomous  self replicating machines  apparently left behind by an alien civilization that visited the planet a very long time ago  The evolution was controlled by robot wars  and the only form that survived were swarms of minuscule  insect like micromachines  Individually  or in small groups  they are quite harmless to humans and capable of only very simple behavior  However  when bothered  they can assemble into huge swarms displaying complex behavior arising from self organization  and are able to defeat an intruder by a powerful surge of EMI  The members of the Condor crew suffered a complete memory erasure as a consequence  Big clouds of insects are also able to travel at a high speed and even to climb to the top of troposphere  The angered crew attempts to fight the perceived enemy  but eventually recognizes the futility of their efforts in the most direct sense of the word  The robotic fauna has become part of the planet ecology  and would require a disruption on planetary scale (such as a nuclear winter) to be destroyed  The novel turns into an analysis of the relationship between different life domains  and their place in the universe  In particular  it is an imaginary experiment to demonstrate that evolution may not necessarily lead to dominance by intellectually superior life forms  The plot also involves a philosophical dilemma  juxtaposing the values of humanity and the efficiency of mechanical insects  In the face of defeat and imminent withdrawal of the Invincible  Rohan  the spaceship navigator  undertakes a trip into the 'enemy area' in search of 4 crew members who went missing in action ‚Äî an attempt which he and captain Horpach see as certainly futile  but necessary for moral reasons  Rohan betakes himself into canyons covered by metallic shrubs and insects and finds the crewmen dead  He gathers some evidence and returns to the ship unharmed thanks to a simple anti detection device and his calm and peaceful behaviour ,1,0,0,0,0

security guard and escapes his room  He finds the manager of the clinic  and learns that he was recovering from a car accident in a private clinic  paid for by his sister  Evelyn Flaumel  He flees and heads to her house  She addresses him as Corwin and calls herself Flora  Hiding his lack of knowledge about what she is saying  he convinces her to let him stay  In Flora library he locates a set of customised Tarot cards‚Äî the Trumps‚Äîwhose Major Arcana are replaced with images which he recognises as his family  As he looks over the cards he remembers all his brothers and sisters: sneaky Random  Julian the hunter  well built G√©rard  the arrogant Eric  himself  Benedict the master tactician and swordsman  sinister Caine  scheming Bleys  and the mysterious Brand  He also views his four sisters: Flora who offered him sanctuary  Deirdre who was dear to him  reserved Llewella  and Fiona  whom Corwin hated  His brother Random contacts him via telephone and Corwin promises to give him protection  Random arrives  pursued by mysterious spined  bloodshot eyed humanoid creatures  and the combined efforts of Corwin  Random  and Flora dogs ultimately defeat them  Random then asks Corwin whether he wishes to walk the road to Amber  from which Corwin agrees  despite the fact he does not know what he is doing  The world changes around them  and Corwin realises that Random is somehow causing the changes in order for them to proceed to Amber  They ultimately end up in the Forest of Arden  the territory of their brother Julian  Julian beasts confront Random and Corwin and eventually Julian himself appears on his steed Morgenstern to take them himself  Corwin dismounts Julian and takes him prisoner  After taking information from Julian he lets him live  saving himself from the remainder of Julian men who were awaiting Corwin in the forest  While traveling they encounter Corwin sister Deirdre who reveals she fled from Eric court  Fully confused at this point  Corwin reveals that he has no memory of what they have been doing or of who he is so Deirdre convinces him to walk the Pattern  which she believes will restore his memory  The three then travel to Rebma  a reflection of Amber underwater  and there they meet their sister Llewella and Moire  the queen of Rebma  Moire originally believes that the three of them came to Rebma to seek support to defeat Eric but Deirdre explains their true intentions  Because Rebma is a reflection of Amber  there is also a reflection of the Pattern in Rebma  which Corwin is to walk to restore his memory  Although Random is impounded for past crimes in Rebma and sentenced to wed a blind girl named Vialle  Corwin convinces the queen Moire to allow him to walk the Pattern  After receiving advice from Random and Deirdre  he walks the Pattern  reliving all of his past life  which stretches back to his time in Amber and when Eric deposited him in Elizabethan England on our Earth  He remembers the powers which his heritage and the Pattern grant him   the power to walk through shadow  and to pronounce a powerful curse before dying  After he completes the Pattern he uses its power to project himself into the Castle of Amber  from which he finds a safe spot and rests  Afterwards he searches the castle and in the library finds a pack of the Trumps and also an old servant friend  However  Eric finds them and the two begin to duel  Although intimidated at first by Eric immense skill  Corwin gets the upper hand in the fight and injures Eric on the arm  Corwin would have won the battle and slain his brother had not the soldiers of the castle realized what was happening and moved to protect Eric  Corwin retreated and using a Trump  contacted his brother Bleys who agreed to harbor him and teleported Corwin to his location  Corwin then agreed to aid Bleys in his attempts to assault Amber and defeat Eric and gathered a large group of warriors from Shadow and assembled a navy  while Bleys created an army on land  From here Corwin attempted to contact his brothers  looking for allies  Caine  although supporting Eric  gave Corwin a promise of safe passage by sea  as did his brother G√©rard  He is unable to contact Benedict but when he attempts to reach Brand  he views him in a prison and Brand desperately asks Corwin to free him before his image disappears  Using a Trump  Corwin then attempts to contact his father Oberon  who has been missing for centuries and makes contact with him  Oberon encourages him to seize the throne but the contact is eventually lost  When he contacts Random  Random reveals that Eric has contacted him and revealed the full extent of his defenses  which are vast and powerful  Furthermore  Random tells Corwin that Eric has gained control over the mysterious Jewel of Judgment  which allows him to control the weather among other things  Despite Random misgivings  Corwin remains resolute in his desire to attack Amber with Bleys  As the invasion begins  Corwin travels with the navy by sea but finds Caine waiting for him with a superior force  apparently in violation of their agreement  Eric then contacts Corwin by Trump  who reveals that he knew about his plans from Caine and the two engage in a mental duel which Corwin is unable to break from  After exchanging taunts  Corwin launches a full mental assault on Eric  which defeats him and leaves him with the knowledge that Corwin is his superior  Corwin then joins in the battle although it is hopeless: Caine forces are already destroying Corwin navy and he escapes by using a Trump to move him to Bleys and his army  Bleys had been constantly assaulted by creatures of Shadow and the poor weather conditions that have been created by Eric usage of the Jewel of Judgment  Although they eventually reach Amber  their forces have dwindled and they barely fight their way up Kolvir  the mountain on which the Castle of Amber is situated  Bleys is ultimately pushed off a cliff  although Corwin throws him his pack of Trumps to allow him to escape the fall  Corwin then uses his few remaining forces and pushes through  eventually breaching to the castle itself  although  before he reaches the throne  his forces are surrounded  and he ultimately is captured  Corwin is brought forth in chains to endure Eric coronation  Julian  who is at Eric side  instructs Corwin to hand the crown of Amber to Eric  who will crown himself King of the one true world  Corwin instead crowns himself King of Amber  but he is quickly beaten by the guards and eventually throws the crown at Eric  Eric then crowns himself  and sentences Corwin to be imprisoned  and his eyes burned out  In his prison beneath the city  Corwin is driven to near insanity  although the visits and smuggled gifts of his friend Lord Rein help him to maintain his spirit and his hope  After a year has passed in blindness and solitude  he is let out to eat at Eric table on the anniversary of the coronation before being thrown into the dungeons again  After years have passed  Corwin eyesight begins to regenerate  and he begins an escape attempt by whittling the door with a spoon he stole from Eric table  Before he can escape in this manner  Dworkin Barimen  the keeper of the Pattern  appears out of nowhere  having seemingly walked through the dungeon wall from a neighboring cell  He explains that he entered Corwin cell by drawing a picture on the dungeon wall and walking through it  and wishes to return in the same way  Corwin gives him the spoon in order to draw a Trump image on the wall  and persuades him to draw the Lighthouse of Cabra on the opposite wall  With this  Corwin projects himself out of his prison  At the Lighthouse of Cabra he meets Jopin  the keeper of the lighthouse but he does not reveal his true identity to him  Jopin cares for Corwin and Corwin aids Jopin in his activities around the lighthouse  Once he is fully recovered  Jopin recognises Corwin  and shows him that the Vale of Garnath  previously a pleasant valley adjacent to Amber  has become a warped and twisted evil place  Corwin takes Jopin craft Butterfly and sails away  while sending a message to Eric via a black bird  stating that he will return to claim the throne ,0,1,0,0,0
472,The Guns of Avalon, Corwin sets out through the endless worlds of shadow in search of Avalon  his one time home  As Corwin nears Avalon  he passes through a land called Lorraine  As it is near to Avalon in Shadow  some aspects of it are similar &mdash; it is a medieval kingdom  ruled once by a shadow version of Corwin  more recently by a king named Uther  The shadow Corwin that once ruled Lorraine  is remembered as a demonic tyrant and Corwin assumes an incognito identity as Sir Corey of Cabra  Corwin comes across a wounded man  whom he recognizes as a shadow of Lance  a knight of Avalon  Corwin carries Lance back to a nearby fortress  the Keep of Ganelon  Along the way  Corwin slays two giant hellcats &mdash; feline demons who call him the opener  confirming his fears that he is responsible for the corruption of the vale of Garnath  Corwin meets with Ganelon  whom he also knows  though Ganelon does not recognize him  Ganelon had once been Corwin right hand man in Avalon  until Ganelon betrayed him (alluding to Ganelon the Traitor  of medieval literature)  for which crime Corwin banished him into an unfamiliar shadow &mdash; this one  apparently &mdash; and left him to die  But Ganelon lived and  as he tells Corwin  rose from leading an outlaw band to become leader of all the forces of Lorraine fighting against a strange evil: a constantly expanding dark circle of toadstools from which demonic creatures and soulless men emerge  Suspecting that this relates to the blood curse he pronounced against Amber (at the end of the previous volume)  Corwin agrees to help  While recuperating from his imprisonment and training with the soldiers of Lorraine  Corwin meets a local camp follower  also named Lorraine  Corwin senses that someone is trying to speak to him by means of the Trumps (magical tarot cards)  and blocks the attempt; Lorraine describes seeing a vision of a man whom Corwin recognizes as his father  She also reveals that her daughter &mdash; whom she had conceived by witchcraft &mdash; was the first person to die in the dark circle  A winged demon  Strygalldwir  arrives at the window to challenge Corwin; Corwin  after demonstrating a little seen spellcasting capability  kills Strygalldwir with his Pattern sword Grayswandir  Corwin  Ganelon  and Lance lead an army against the dark circle  On the top floor of a tower  Corwin slays the enemy leader  a goat headed creature  The enemy is revealed to come from the Courts of Chaos  a place far across Shadow from Amber  past where the shadows cease to follow ordinary rules of reality  Lorraine runs off with an office called Melkin  Corwin pursues them; finding that Melkin has murdered and robbed Lorraine  he kills Melkin  Corwin and Ganelon journey on toward Avalon  A young deserter tells them that the forces of Avalon  led by a man known as the Protector  have recently been battling a horde of demonic  cave dwelling hellmaids &mdash; a force of evil somehow similar to the dark circle in Lorraine  Corwin and Ganelon journey on and meet the Protector  who turns out to be Corwin long lost brother Benedict  the most formidable swordsman and military strategist in existence  Benedict forces have defeated the hellmaids  but he has lost his arm in the battle  Benedict greets Corwin cordially  but refuses to support his claim to the throne  Benedict also reveals that their father  King Oberon  did not abdicate  as Corwin had believed  but simply vanished  Benedict sends Corwin and Ganelon on to his country house  There  Corwin meets a young woman named Dara  who tells him that she is Benedict great granddaughter  Because of her bloodline  she is anxious to learn more about the Pattern of Amber  Walking the Pattern gives the royalty of Amber the ability to walk in Shadow  Trading information with her  Corwin learns that Benedict has been visited there by brothers Julian  G√©rard  and Brand  In Avalon  Corwin arranges to purchase large amounts of jeweler rouge  obtaining capital by journeying through Shadow to a parallel Earth where he harvests diamonds from an African coast that has never seen human habitation  Returning to Benedict house  he encounters Ganelon  who jokingly tells him that several fresh human bodies are buried in the garden  Corwin is reluctant to get involved in the local intrigue  Later  Dara finds him  and they become lovers  Corwin sets off into Shadow with his jeweler rouge  He and Ganelon notice a strange phenomenon: a black road  similar to the dark circle in Lorraine  cuts through Shadow  apparently stretching from Amber to all the Shadows  The grass along the black road encircles the ankles of Ganelon  and Corwin has to free him  Corwin is able to destroy a section of the black road by focusing his mind on the Pattern  then Corwin receives a Trump contact  which he assumes to be from Benedict  Corwin believes Benedict to be angry at having discovered either that Corwin has been using Avalon to arm himself for an attempt on the throne (compromising Benedict neutrality) or that Corwin has slept with Dara  Corwin tries to escape further into Shadow  but Benedict pursues and eventually catches him  Benedict accuses Corwin of being a murderer  to Corwin surprise  and a duel ensues  Completely outmatched  Corwin tricks Benedict into moving into a patch of the strange black grass  allowing Corwin to knock him unconscious  Corwin summons G√©rard via Trump to care for Benedict  Corwin journeys to our Earth  and has an assembly line set up to produce the ammunition he needs to assault Amber  While that is happening  he visits his old house in New York  where he finds a message from Eric  pleading for peace  Corwin rejects this  He recruits his army from a similar Shadow to the one home to the army he recruited for his assault with Bleys  and trains them in the use of firearms  Then he leads them through shadow to attack Amber  However  upon reaching Amber  Corwin finds a desperate battle against wyvern riders from the Courts of Chaos  He also finds Dara wandering about the battlefield  and orders some men to guard her  After assisting in the battle and dispatching the threat  he confronts Eric  who has been wounded during the battle  Before he dies  Eric passes the Jewel of Judgement to Corwin and pronounces his death curse on the enemies of Amber  Dara  having disposed of her guards  rides past Corwin on horseback  toward Amber  Corwin  suddenly apprehensive  contacts his brother Random via trump  and has Random teleport him into Amber  They reach the chamber of the Pattern to find that Dara is already walking it  shifting into all manner of strange and grotesque shapes as she does  Completing her Pattern walk  she announces to Corwin in a low  inhuman voice that Amber will be destroyed  then vanishes ,0,1,0,0,0
473,Sign of the Unicorn, Corwin returns to Castle Amber bearing the body of one of the spined  bloodshot eyed humanoid creatures that had pursued Random to Flora house on Earth‚Äîone that had moments earlier killed his brother  Caine  Fearing that he has been framed for Caine murder  Corwin summons Random  who tells him the story how he came to be chased across shadow to end up in New York: Random had been enjoying life out in a shadow  Texorami  that he had selected/created to be an ideal place to gamble  hang glide and especially play the drums  One day he received an unusual Trump call in the form of the Jack of Diamonds  that spoke to him as his brother  Brand  asking for help to escape from an unfamiliar shadow  Random set out to rescue Brand from the shadow  a land lit without a sun  where boulders orbit each other in complicated patterns  He found the tower where Brand was imprisoned  but could not overcome its guardian  a transparent  glass  prismatic  dragon like creature  Spined humanoids pursued random through shadow  Seeking an ally  he headed for Earth  hoping to exploit Flora  but finds Corwin instead  Since Corwin had been missing for so long  Random assumes the creatures belonged to him  and though confused when Corwin fights the creatures  is sufficiently frightened to aid Corwin in getting to Amber  After hearing Random story  Corwin descends to the chamber of the Pattern  to attune himself to the Jewel of Judgement  a powerful artifact given to Corwin by Eric as he lay dying  which gives its wearer among other powers control of weather in Amber  He walks the pattern  and then commands it to project him into the Jewel  He is metaphysically carried through a higher dimensional Pattern within the Jewel  emerging with what he describes as a higher octave of awareness  Corwin then teleports himself to a high tower of the castle  After testing his new attunement to the Jewel  he summons Flora  He learns that most of his brothers had sought him in shadow during his absence ‚Äî some to try to find him; some to implicate Eric in their father  Oberon death  G√©rard accompanies Corwin to the Grove of the Unicorn  where Caine was killed  G√©rard fights Corwin  and later threatens him physically while all of the siblings are watching through trumps and is told that if he turns out to be responsible for Caine death  G√©rard will kill him  and that if G√©rard is killed  the siblings will know Corwin did it  Corwin points out that if someone wants to kill Corwin and free themselves from suspicion  they now only have to kill G√©rard  G√©rard  angered  accuses him of trying to complicate matters  The two brothers return to Caine body  and see a glimpse of the Unicorn  Corwin then arranges a family meeting  allowing Random to re tell his tale  While not entirely convinced of Corwin innocence  they agree to attempt to recover the one remaining person who has seen these creatures ‚Äî Brand  With their combined efforts  they are able to contact Brand through the trump  and pull him through to Amber  Although Brand was relatively intact in his cell  they find he has been stabbed as he is brought to them  G√©rard pushes the others aside and gives first aid to Brand  while the others realize the implications of the stabbing ‚Äî one of them must have tried to kill their brother  The siblings guardedly discuss who the would be murderer might be  Fiona points out that only she and Julian are sensible suspects ‚Äî and she is innocent of all but malice  She also warns Corwin that the Jewel is more than just a weather control device; in truth  it is an artifact of great power which draws upon its bearer life force ‚Äî and may well have been what killed Eric  She says that when people around the bearer seem to be statue like  the bearer is near death  Corwin heads for his rooms  discussing matters with Random  who has a hard time keeping up with Corwin  Corwin enters his room  but notices too late a figure poised to stab him  However the stab itself appears to be so slow that it only grazes him  Corwin blacks out  He awakens in his former home on Earth  bleeding and nearing death  He drops a pillow  but it hangs in the air  He realizes that the Jewel is killing him  so he hides it in the house compost heap and heads for the road  hoping to hitch hike to a hospital where he can recover  He is eventually picked up by Bill Roth  a lawyer who recognizes him as Carl Corey  the name Corwin had used in the past to pass for a human  In hospital  he learns that his car accident happened during his escape from a mental asylum  where he had been committed by a Dr  Hillary B  Rand by his brother Brandon Corey  He is contacted via Trump by Random  who returns him to Amber  saying that Brand has woken up and wishes to speak to him  Brand gradually tells Corwin about how he  Bleys and Fiona had removed Oberon and tried to claim the throne  but were opposed by the triumvirate of Eric  Julian and Caine  He says that after he objected to Bleys and Fiona plan to ally with the forces of Chaos  he was pursued and came to Earth seeking Corwin as an ally‚Äîtrying to restore his memories with shock therapy‚Äîbut was captured and imprisoned in the tower where Random found him  During the conversation  Brand displays pyrokinetic abilities  Corwin then heads to Tir na Nog'th  the mysterious  moonlit Amber in the sky where he hopes to gain insight into the situation  His sword Grayswandir has special properties in the moonlit city  having been forged upon the stairway to Tir na Nog'th  With Random and Ganelon watching him from mount Kolvir  he ascends to Tir na Nog'th  and in the throne room sees Dara as queen  flanked by Benedict wearing a metallic arm  This dream version of Dara tells him her origins and the ghostly Benedict is able to reach Corwin with the arm  A fight ensues  Corwin cuts off the arm  and is trumped back to Kolvir by Random  with the arm still clutching his shoulder  The three set off for Amber  but are drawn through shadow ‚Äî which should be impossible this close to Amber ‚Äî and come to an enlarged version of the Grove of the Unicorn  where they see the eponymous beast  They are led back to where Amber should stand  but instead there is a plateau on which there is a copy of the Pattern  With a shock  Corwin and Ganelon realize that this is the true  Primal Pattern  of which the one in Amber is but the first shadow ,0,1,0,0,0
474,The Hand of Oberon, Corwin  Random and Ganelon go down to the Primal Pattern and see that it is damaged  with a dark stain obscuring the pattern from the center to one edge  in the shape of the corrupted Vale of Garnath  They also see a pair of objects at the pattern centre  While Corwin and Random discuss whether it would be safe to walk a damaged pattern  Ganelon runs through the stain to the center and retrieves the objects   a dagger  and a pierced Trump card  A purple griffin like beast emerges from a cave  and Random horse runs onto the pattern  The horse is consumed/ripped apart by a rainbow coloured tornado  Ganelon discusses what it was like to run on the stain  and asks Random to drop a small amount of blood on the pattern  The blood drop stains the pattern in the same way  and they realize that the trump must have been used to spill blood onto the pattern by someone at its centre  Random recognizes the trump as that of his Rebman son  Martin  Corwin recognises the style of the trump as that of Brand  Ganelon proposes that Corwin use the Trumps to contact Benedict  who transports them to the slopes of mount Kolvir  Random and Benedict  who had known and was fond of Martin  set off through shadow to find him  or if necessary avenge his death  Corwin returns to Amber to inform Random wife  Vialle  that Random will be gone for a while  Discussing matters with her  he realizes that now Eric is dead he no longer wants the throne   but he still loves Amber and wishes to repair the damage  even though he is no longer sure it is his fault  Corwin then descends into the depths of the castle to find his former cell in the dungeons  On the way to his cell  Corwin meets Roger Zelazny  who makes an appearance in his own book  The author describes himself as a    lean  cadaverous figure    smoking his pipe  grinning around it  In his dialogue with Corwin  Roger states that he is presently    writing a philosophical romance shot through with elements of horror and morbidity  This may or may not be a not so subtle description of the entire Chronicles of Amber series  Once in his former cell  Corwin uses the trump that Dworkin drew on the wall to project himself to the mad sorcerer chambers  Dworkin incorrectly assumes that Corwin is Oberon  and reveals to him in a vaguely metaphoric manner that he  Dworkin  is Oberon father (and that the mother was the Unicorn!)  and that he drew the Pattern using the Jewel of Judgement  which was given to him by the Unicorn after he fled from Chaos  Dworkin then describes how the damage to the Pattern could be fixed if he destroyed himself  erasing the pattern and allowing Oberon to draw another  Dworkin takes Corwin to the Primal Pattern  past the purple griffin  Wixer  Dworkin then realizes that it is Corwin  and explains that there is a way to mend the Pattern using the Jewel of Judgement  though that would be more difficult  and probably fatal to the person who attempted it  Dworkin then loses control of his madness  transforming into a monstrous beast and pursuing Corwin back into his chambers  Corwin escapes via a Trump which he finds there  He finds himself in the Courts of Chaos  a great castle which looks out over the Abyss  a swirling black/white hole  under a half colored stripy  half black swirly sky  Corwin remembers being brought here as a child by Oberon  to see that this is in fact the true source of all creation  not Amber  A strange  pale rider attacks Corwin  but is defeated  A familiar seeming man approaches with a crossbow  but spares Corwin after recognizing him by his blade  Corwin contacts G√©rard via Trump  and learns that because of the time differential between Amber and Chaos he has been missing for eight days  Corwin takes the pierced trump of Martin to Brand  who admits stabbing Martin through the trump in order to damage the pattern  as part of his cabal scheme to capture Oberon  He tries to persuade Corwin to use the Trump to kill Bleys and Fiona  as he was stabbed  He asks for the Jewel to help him to restrain them  but Corwin is unconvinced  Ganelon  who is with Benedict  contacts Corwin via Trump  Benedict is now wearing the metallic arm from Tir na Nog'th  Corwin gives Benedict the trump of the Courts  G√©rard arrives via Trump  Brand has gone missing  and his room is covered in blood  G√©rard becomes convinced that Corwin has finished Brand off  and starts to fight Corwin  Ganelon stops G√©rard punch and knocks him unconscious with several blows  giving Corwin time to escape  Corwin flees into the forest of Arden  hoping to retrieve the Jewel from Earth  A manticora follows him  but Julian arrives and kills it  Julian explains that the Eric Julian Caine triumvirate arose only to oppose Brand cabal  taking the throne to prevent Bleys from claiming it  When Corwin arrived with Bleys  they assumed he had joined the cabal  but when (after his capture) they realized he only wanted the throne  Julian suggested blinding him as an alternative to killing him  Julian tells Corwin how Brand has acquired strange powers  including becoming a living Trump  capable of teleporting himself or other objects through shadow  Corwin proceeds to Earth  musing on his new found respect for Julian  He arrives to find that the compost heap where he hid the Jewel of Judgment is gone  With the help of Bill Roth  he tracks down the heap  but the Jewel has been claimed by a red headed artist  Corwin contacts Amber and has guards posted on the Patterns in Amber and Rebma  hoping to prevent Brand from using them to attune himself to the Jewel  Fiona contacts him via Trump  and projects herself to Earth  She then leads Corwin to the Primal Pattern  taking a short cut through a starry tunnel  She explains that she and Bleys had imprisoned Brand because he had decided to destroy the Pattern and re create  reshaping the multiverse according to his own liking  They kept him alive because they believed he might be helpful in repairing the damage  She also explains that Brand tried to kill Corwin on Earth because he saw a vision in Tir na Nog'th that Corwin would defeat him  Fiona confirms that Bleys survived the fall from the cliff in the first book  They arrive to find Brand already on the Primal Pattern  Corwin follows  hoping to slay Brand while he is distracted  but he realises that slaying Brand would further damage the Pattern  He instead gets close enough to ask the Jewel to summon a tornado  which seems to destroy Brand as it did Random horse  However  Fiona assures Corwin that Brand survived  Leaving Fiona to guard the Primal Pattern  Corwin goes to his tomb to meet Random and Martin  who have just arrived  Martin tells Corwin how he was attacked by Brand  and how he met Dara in shadow  Ganelon contacts Corwin to tell him that Tir na Nog'th will appear tonight  along with its version of the Pattern  Reasoning that Brand will attempt to attune himself there  Ganelon asks Benedict to walk the Pattern in Amber  ready to teleport himself there when it appears and tells Corwin to keep permanent contact with Benedict through the Trump to teleport him out in case the city becomes immaterial  Corwin rides to the top of Kolvir and contacts Benedict via the Trump  Tir na Nog'th appears  and Benedict teleports himself there  Brand appears shortly afterwards  and tries to persuade Benedict to allow him to re create the Pattern  Benedict refuses and Brand  partly attuned to the Jewel  uses it to freeze Benedict in place  Neither Corwin nor Benedict can now prevent Brand from walking Tir na Nog'th Pattern and fully attuning himself to the Jewel  but the mechanical arm moves of its own accord  snatching the Jewel and choking Brand with the chain  Brand teleports away  leaving the chain  Corwin and Benedict decide that the arm being the right weapon in the right place at the right time is too unlikely a coincidence to be true  and so it must have been arranged by some guiding force ‚Äî Oberon  Together  they try Oberon Trump  and find that contact comes easily  They are answered by a grinning Ganelon ,0,1,0,0,0

that Oberon has succeeded or failed  Brand arrives  telling him that he watched Oberon fail  and that Corwin must give him the Jewel so he can create a new Pattern  Corwin refuses  and forces Brand to leave  He notices an unusually large storm following him  and takes refuge in a cave  The cave other occupant  a nameless stranger who has also sought shelter from the storm  casually mentions some local legends about the Archangel Corwin  who  according to scripture will ride before a storm at the end of the world  The real Corwin dismisses this story as nonsense and commands the Jewel to quell the storm  Eventually he falls asleep  When he wakes  his horse has been kidnapped  He says goodbye to the stranger and tracks his horse to a cave  blocked off by a large boulder  which he shatters  Inside  leprechauns are celebrating a feast  Observing his great strength  they return his horse and invite him to join them  Succumbing to their odd charm  he starts to fall asleep  but rouses

continues striding through shadow  Corwin cuts a branch off a tree as a walking aid  The tree complains  but when it learns that he is Oberon son it gives him its blessing  It says that it is Ygg  and that Oberon planted it in Amber distant past to mark the boundary between Order and Chaos  It tells him to plant the staff somewhere it will have the chance to grow  A talking raven named Hugi (of the usual color) arrives  and tries to distract Corwin with fatalistic philosophy  It shows Corwin the head of a mostly drowned Giant  who will not even allow the possibility of rescue  A mythological jackal offers to lead Corwin on a short cut to the Courts  but instead leads him to its lair  where Corwin kills it in self defense  He finally finds a shadow with the Courts' sky  but is aghast to discover that the Courts still lie across a huge wasteland  The raven Hugi returns and pointedly tells him it knew all along  so he kills it for his dinner  As the metaphysical storm approaches Chaos  Corwin decides that Oberon must have failed  so he plants his staff and begins to use the Jewel to inscribe a new Pattern  The process evokes memories of his former life in Paris  France  and we are

476,Roadmarks, The central theme of the novel is time travel using a highway that links all times and all possible histories  Exits from the highway lead to different times and places  Changing events in the past cause some exits further up the road  in the future  to become overgrown and inaccessible and new exits to appear  leading to different alternative futures  The narrator and protagonist  Red Dorakeen  has vague memories of a place or time that is no longer accessible from the Road  He runs guns to the Greeks at Marathon  trying to recreate history as he remembers it in an attempt to open a new exit from the Road to his half remembered place  The phrase Last Exit to Babylon was the manuscript title of the book and appears on the cover art; it was later used as a title for Volume Four in the Collected Stories of Roger Zelazny collection  All One chapters feature Red Dorakeen  and all Two chapters feature secondary characters  These are Red natural son Randy  newly introduced to the Road and tired of his old life in Ohio; a bevy of would be assassins attempting to kill Red  some of whom are comic references to pulp characters  or real people (it is implied that Ambrose Bierce is writing a novel somewhere on the metaphysical highway) and Leila  a woman whose fate is bound to Red in mysterious and unexplained ways  The One storyline is fairly linear  but the Two storyline jumps around in time and sequence  first bringing in Randy and Leila without introduction  then later showing Randy introduction to the Road and meeting with Leila  who will/has just abandoned Red following an incident in the One timeline  Everything comes clear in the final chapter  however  There are a number of interesting humorous touches and allusions in the story  These include an ancient dragon who falls in love with a tyrannosaurus  a futuristic warrior robot left behind by aliens because it is malfunctioning and has now taken up pottery  a lost crusader who now works in a gas station located somewhere on the timeless road  occasionally asking his customers about the current status of the Holy Land  an ancient Sumerian who buries artifacts later to be found by himself as archaeologist  along with the brief appearances of pulp heroes such as Doc Savage and John Sunlight as well as real historical figures  including Jack the Ripper  Marquis de Sade and an angry Adolf Hitler (who is furiously searching for the place where he won) ,1,0,0,0,0
477,Lord of Light, Lord of Light is set on a planet colonized by some of the remnants of vanished Urath  or Earth  The crew and colonists from the spaceship Star of India found themselves on a strange planet surrounded by hostile indigenous races and had to carve a place for themselves or perish  To increase their chances of survival  the crew has used chemical treatments  biofeedback and electronics to mutate their minds and create enhanced self images  or Aspects  that strengthened their bodies and intensified their wills and extended the power of their desires into Attributes  which fell with a force like magic upon those against whom they were turned  The crew has also developed a technology to transfer a person atman  or soul  electronically to a new body  This reincarnation by mind transfer has created a race of potential immortals and allowed the former crew members to institute the Hindu caste system  with themselves at the top  The novel covers great spans of time  Eventually  the crew used their now great powers to subjugate or destroy the native non human races (whom they characterize as demons) while setting themselves up as gods in the eyes of the many generations of colonist progeny  Taking on the powers and names of Hindu deities  these gods maintain respect and control of the masses by maintaining a stranglehold on the access to reincarnation and by suppressing any technological advancements beyond a medieval level  The gods fear that any enlightenment or advancement might lead to a technological renaissance that would eventually weaken their power  The protagonist  Sam  who has developed the ability to manipulate electromagnetic forces  is a renegade crewman who has rejected godhood  Sam is the last Accelerationist: He believes that technology should be available to the masses  and that reincarnation should not be controlled by the elite  Sam introduces Buddhism as a culture jamming tool and strives to cripple the power of the gods with this new religion  His carefully planned revolt against the gods takes place in stages: An army  great in space  may offer opposition in a brief span of time  One man  brief in space  must spread his opposition across a period of many years if he is to have a chance of succeeding  In many ways  the story of Lord of Light mirrors that of the novel Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse  (for characters  see descriptions below) # In a monastery  the deathgod Yama ‚Äì assisted by Tak  the ape (formerly Tak the Archivist for the gods) and Ratri  Goddess of Night ‚Äì assembles a clandestine radio transceiver to extract Sam atman  or soul  from the Bridge of the Gods  the planet thick ionosphere  and restore it to a body  Sam bodiless essence was projected by the gods into the ionosphere after his capture in the battle of Keenset  This mode of execution was used because the last time the gods killed his body  Sam returned and stole a new one from one of the lesser gods  When Sam awakes  he claims to be horrified to be back in the flesh  having been aware of his ethereal condition the whole time  and having experienced it as a blissful Nirvana  He wants to return  to hear the song the stars sing on the shores of the great sea  Eventually  after meditation on and immersion in earthly senses  he returns fully to the world  Shortly after  an encounter with the god Mara  who had come to investigate the disturbances caused by Yama machinery  causes the conspirators to flee  As they proceed  Sam muses on his past      # Prince Siddhartha  entering old age  comes down to the city of Mahartha to obtain a new body  He finds that there have been changes while he has lived on his estates  Before getting the body  he must submit to a mind probe  operated by the Masters of Karma  which will be used to determine his fitness for reincarnation  Those judged unfit are given diseased bodies or even reincarnated as animals such as dogs  The dogs then act as spies for the Masters  Siddhartha contacts Jan Olvegg  former captain of the Star of India  reveals himself as Sam  and realizes from what he is told that he cannot remain passive  and must proceed against the Gods  He raids the House of Karma  steals bodies for himself  Olvegg  and others  and causes the former Chief Master of Karma to be reincarnated as a dog  He then disappears to execute the next stage of his plan  # The Buddha appears  preaching a philosophy of non violence that undermines the doctrine of obedience to the gods and the struggle for a better rebirth  Instead  he emphasizes the pursuit of Nirvana and release from the illusion of the world  The goddess Kali  realizing that this is Sam work  sends her personal executioner  Rild  to kill Sam  but Rild falls ill and is found and tended to by the Buddhist acolytes  as well as by Sam himself  Because he owes Sam his life  Rild renounces his mission after he recovers  He becomes one of Sam disciples  eventually exceeding his teacher wisdom  He takes the name Sugata  preaching in earnest what Sam had done only calculatingly as a way to overthrow the gods  Yama descends to kill Sam  Sugata/Rild faces Yama on a treetrunk bridge over a river  knowing he cannot defeat the God of Death  but fighting him anyway  Yama kills Rild and proceeds to find Sam  However  Sam tricks Yama and escapes  promising to return with new weapons  Sam also warns Yama against the machinations of Yama beloved Kali  and in so doing makes a personal enemy of Yama  # Sam enters Hellwell  a huge pit where he had bound the demons centuries earlier  He negotiates with their leader  Taraka  for allies in his struggle  He frees Taraka to see the world above  but Taraka betrays him by taking possession of Sam body  promising to resume the bargain later  While in control of Sam body  Taraka deposes a local maharajah and takes over his palace and harem  As Sam recovers control of his body  he finds himself becoming more like Taraka  enjoying the pleasures of the flesh  In turn  Taraka takes on some aspects of Sam  and ceases to revel in his life of pleasure  Sam tells him he has suffered the Curse of the Buddha  which is revealed to be a conscience and guilt  Soon after  Agni  God of Fire  arrives to kill Sam  finding instead two spirits in one body  Agni destroys the palace  while Sam/Taraka flees to Hellwell  They decide to free as many demons as possible before the gods arrive  However  even the full might of all the demons of Hellwell cannot stand against the gods  A mere four of the gods  Yama  Kali  Shiva  and Agni  are able to hold off the demons and pursue Sam  Despite his own powers  Sam is captured and Taraka leaves him  Sam is told that he is to be taken to Heaven and made an example of  lest the other gods try to emulate his rebellion  # In the place called Heaven  Yama and Kali are to be married  Tak of the Bright Spear is the Archivist of Heaven  but is suspect because he was fathered in lifetimes past by Sam  However  Tak main concern is seducing comely demi goddesses such as Maya  the Mistress of Illusion  Sam is more or less free to wander Heaven  even trysting with Kali  who would like to have him back as her lover  He preaches to any who will listen  and the gods allow this  hoping to flush out sympathizers  However  Sam knows of some of his old gadgetry locked away in one of the museums in Heaven  and with the help of Helba  the Goddess of Thieves  he attempts an escape using a belt that amplifies his powers  This fails  and Kali  disgusted with herself and with him  persuades Brahma to order a human sacrifice  namely Helba and Sam himself  to celebrate her wedding  Sam is set free once more to flee for his life  hunted by the White Tigers of Kaniburrha  some of whom may be reincarnated gods  perhaps even Kali herself  Tak attempts to protect Sam by killing the tigers  but is struck down by Ganesha  For this  Tak is sent out of Heaven in the body of an ape  The wedding proceeds  with Sam apparently dead  # Brahma is dead  He has been murdered by persons or gods unknown  Vishnu  Shiva  and Ganesha gather to quickly arrange a replacement  They decide that the only viable candidate is Kali  However  for her to be reincarnated as Brahma (a man)  her short marriage to Yama must end  Yama is appalled at how coldly she accepts this  Next  Shiva is found murdered  Yama throws himself into investigating the deaths  His friend  Kubera  approaches the demigod Murugan and accuses him of the murders  finally addressing him as Sam  It appears that Sam has become part demon  and can survive without a body  He displaced Murugan spirit as Murugan was about to occupy a new body for the wedding feast  Kubera uncovered the deception by examining the brainwave records from the transfer  Instead of turning Sam in  Kubera offers to help him escape  Sam refuses  determined to kill as many gods as he can  Since Kubera friend  Yama  is the obvious next target  Kubera tricks Sam  who has forgotten what a great warrior the fat old man was  and in a bout of Irish Stand Down (in which two men take turns hitting each other until one cannot continue)  knocks him out and prepares to flee on the giant bird Garuda  They recruit Ratri to stop Yama from interfering  and take her along  They flee to the city of Keenset  which is undergoing a technological revival  and is marked for destruction by the gods  Eventually  Yama  feeling betrayed by Kali and the other gods  joins them  With Yama weaponry  and various allies  including the zombie army of Nirriti the Black  they fight a titanic battle of gods  men  and monsters  killing thousands of men  demigods  and eventually some gods as well  They go down in defeat  but not before dealing a crushing blow to the hierarchy of heaven  Yama apparently commits suicide  but some suspect that he has invented a remote reincarnation device  Ratri is exiled from heaven and condemned to wander the world in a series of homely bodies  Kubera had hidden himself in a vault  held in suspended animation  Sam  having proved himself unkillable  is instead projected into the ring of ions around the planet  known as the Bridge of the Gods  However  the gods win only a pyrrhic victory  The most powerful deities  such as Yama  Brahma  Shiva  and Agni  are now dead or sworn enemies of Heaven  Others have gone into exile rather than fight against Sam  While Brahma/Kali is exultant  Ganesha realizes that the days of Heaven are numbered  and he must look out for himself  # In the final story  Sam has been returned from Nirvana  Sam  together with Yama  Ratri  and Kubera  plan their next move in their campaign against heaven  They are joined by the drunken god Krishna  who is a great fighter when sober  and who has wandered the world since he went into exile rather than fight at Keenset  Meanwhile  Nirriti  a Christian and the former chaplain of the original ship  has amassed great power in the southern continent  He is laying waste to cities in his attempts to stamp out the Hindu religion that he hates  He has acquired enough technology to challenge anything the gods can muster  even if they resort to the tall man of smoke who wears a wide hat  apparently a reference to a nuclear device  He is also allied with the freed demons  At first he seems to be a natural ally for Sam and Yama  but they entrust the demon Taraka with conveying a message to him  and Taraka is determined to fight Yama  to prove that Taraka is the mightiest being on the planet  Thus Taraka falsely tells them that Nirriti has refused  and instead they ally with Brahma to defeat Nirriti  if Brahma will consent to their demands  This alliance defeats Nirriti in a final battle  despite Ganesha attempt at betrayal  but at a huge cost  Brahma (the former Kali)  fatally wounded  is conveyed from the battlefield by Yama  Later  Kubera finds Yama with his daughter  whom he calls Murga  She is retarded  and Yama admits that this was due to a botched mind transfer  Kubera  always ready to help his friend  uses his powers to stimulate Murga mind  Sam sees Tak restored to a young body  as is Ratri  Sam then leaves  no one is sure where to  Myths build up around his life and his departure ,1,0,0,0,0

479,The Tommyknockers,While walking in the woods near the small town of Haven  Maine; Roberta (Bobbi) Anderson  a writer of Wild West themed fiction  stumbles upon a metal object which turns out to be a protrusion of a long buried alien spacecraft  Once exposed  the spacecraft begins releasing an invisible  odorless gas into the atmosphere which gradually transforms people into beings similar to the aliens who populated the spacecraft  The transformation  or becoming  provides them with a limited form of genius which makes them very inventive  but does not provide any philosophical or ethical insight  Instead  it provokes psychotic violence (on the part of people like Becka Paulson  who kills her adulterous husband by fatally rewiring their TV  killing herself in the process) and the disappearance of a young boy  David Brown  whose older brother Hilly teleports him to another planet  referred to as Altair 4 by the Havenites  The book central protagonist is a poet and friend of Bobbi Anderson  named James Eric Gardner  who goes by the nickname Gard  He is a fundamentally decent person with left leaning  liberal sensibilities who is apparently immune to the ship effects because of a steel plate in his head  a souvenir of a teenage skiing accident  Unfortunately  Gard is also an alcoholic  prone to binges which result in violent outbursts followed by lengthy blackouts  His relationship with Bobbi deteriorates as the novel progresses  She is almost totally overcome by the euphoria of becoming one with the spacecraft  but Gard increasingly sees her health worsen and her sanity disappear  The novel is filled with metaphors for the stranglehold of substance abuse  which King himself was experiencing at the time  as well as for the dangers of nuclear power and radioactive fallout (as evidenced by the physical transformations of the townspeople  which resemble the effects of radiation exposure)  of unchecked technological advancement  and of the corrupting influence of power  Government agencies are uniformly portrayed as corrupt and totalitarian throughout the book  and Bobbi and Gard themselves are led into thinking that they can use the ship power as a weapon to thwart the authorities' nefarious designs  Seeing the transformation of the townspeople worsen  the torture and manipulation of Bobbi dog Peter  and people being killed or worse when they pry too deeply into the strange events  Gardner eventually manipulates Bobbi into allowing him into the ship  After he sees that Bobbi is not entirely his old friend and lover  he gives her one more chance before deciding to kill her with the same gun that state trooper Monster Dugan had almost killed her with in her back field previously  However  Bobbi was able to read Gardner mind after loading him up with Valium  and sent out a telepathic APB when she sensed he had a gun  As a result  her death sends all the townspeople swarming to her place intent on killing Gardner  Meanwhile  Gard accidentally (by dropping the gun) shoots himself in the ankle  Ev Hillman  David and Hilly grandfather  helps Gardner escape into the woods (which soon catches fire from one of the Tommyknockers' toys) in exchange for using the new and improved computers and what little becoming he underwent to save David Brown  Gardner enters the ship  activates it  and with the last of his life telepathically launches it into space  resulting in the eventual deaths of nearly all of the changed townspeople but preventing the possibly disastrous consequences of the ship influence spreading to the outside world  Very shortly after (in the epilogue) members from the FBI  CIA  and The Shop invade Haven and take as many of the Havenites as possible (they kill nearly a quarter of the survivors) and a few of the devices created by the altered people of Haven  In the last pages  David Brown is discovered in Hilly Brown hospital room  safe and sound  The book takes its title from an old children rhyme: King himself wrote the second verse; and claims to have heard the first verse when he was a child ,1,0,0,0,0

481,Anthem,Equality 7 2521  writing in a tunnel under the earth  later revealed to be an ancient subway tunnel  explains his background  the society around him  and his emigration  His exclusive use of plural pronouns (we  our  they) to refer to himself and others tells a tale of complete socialization and governmental control  The idea of the World Council was to eliminate all individualist ideas  It was so stressed  that people were burned at the stake for saying an Unspeakable Word (I  Me  Myself  and Ego)  He recounts his early life  He was raised  like all children in the world of Anthem  away from his parents in the Home of the Infants  then transferred to the Home of the Students  where he began his schooling  Later  he realized that he was born with a curse: He is eager to think and question  and unwilling to give up himself for others  which violates the principles upon which Anthems society is founded  He excelled in math and science  and dreamed of becoming a Scholar  However  a Council of Vocations assigned all people to their jobs  and he was assigned to the Home of the Street Sweepers  Equality accepts his profession willingly in order to repent for his transgression (his desire to learn)  He works with International 4 8818 and Union 5 3992  International is exceptionally tall  a great artist (which is his transgression  as only people chosen to be artists may draw)  and Equality only friend (having a friend also being a crime because  in Anthems society  one is not supposed to prefer one of one brothers over the rest)  Union  they of the half brain  suffers from some sort of neurological seizures  However  Equality remains curious  One day  he finds the entrance to a subway tunnel in his assigned work area and explores it  despite International 4 8818 protests that an action unauthorized by a Council is forbidden  Equality realizes that the tunnel is left over from the Unmentionable Times  before the creation of Anthems society  and is curious about it  During the daily three hour long play  he leaves the rest of the community at the theater and enters the tunnel and undertakes scientific experiments  Working outside the City one day  by a field  Equality meets and falls in love with a woman  Liberty 5 3000  whom he names The Golden One  Liberty 5 3000 names Equality The Unconquered  Continuing his scientific work  Equality rediscovers electricity (which he  until the book nears its conclusion  calls the power of the sky) and the light bulb  He makes a decision to take his inventions to the World Council of Scholars when they arrive in his town in a few days' time  so that they will recognize his talent and allow him to work with them  as well as to make what he sees as a valuable contribution to his fellow men  However  one night he loses track of time in the underground tunnel and his absence from the Home of the Street Sweepers is noticed  When he refuses to say where he has been  he is arrested and sent to the Palace of Corrective Detention  from which he easily escapes after being tortured  The day after his escape  he walks in on the World Council of Scholars and presents his work to them  Horrified  they reject it because it was not authorized by a Council and threatens to upset the equilibrium of their world  When they try to destroy his invention  he takes it and flees into the Uncharted Forest which lies outside the City  Upon entering the Uncharted Forest  Equality begins to realize that he is free  that he no longer must wake up every morning with his brothers to sweep the streets  Since it was illegal for men of the City to enter or even think of the Forest  he was not pursued once he crossed its threshold  He can rise  or run  or leap  or fall down again  Now that he sees this  he is not stricken with the sense that he will die at the fangs of the beasts of the forest as a result of his transgressions  He develops a new understanding of the world and his place in it  On his second day of living in the forest  Equality stumbles upon the Golden One  Liberty 5 3000  who has followed him from the City  They embrace  struggling to express their feelings for each other as they do not know how to verbally express themselves as individuals  They find and enter a house from the Unmentionable Times in the mountains  perfectly preserved for hundreds of years by thick overgrowth  and decide to live in it  While reading books from the house library  Equality and Liberty discover that the Unspeakable Word  the one that carries the penalty of death  is I  given through the power of ego  Recognizing its sacred value and the individuality it expresses  they give themselves new names from the books: Equality becomes Prometheus and Liberty

487,The Futurological Congress,Ijon Tichy is sent to the Eighth World Futurological Congress in Costa Rica by professor Tarantoga  The conference is set to focus on the world overpopulation crisis and ways of dealing with it  It is held at the Costa Rica Hilton in Nounas  which is 164 stories tall  Lem is fiercely satirical from the start  and absurdities abound at the Hilton with its guaranteed 'BOMB FREE' rooms and the extravagances of Tichy suite  which include a palm grove and an 'all girl orchestra [that] played Bach while performing a cleverly choreographed striptease'  The conference itself is no less absurd  Papers and presenters are too numerous to allow for full presentations  Instead  papers are distributed in hard copy and speakers call out paragraph numbers to call attention to their most salient points  In the middle of his first night at the conference  Tichy drinks some tap water in his hotel room  and his wild hallucinogenic trip begins  though it never becomes any more or less absurd than the brief glimpse of reality Lem presents in the beginning of the book (if indeed the congress is meant to be reality)  He realizes the next day that the government has drugged the public water supply with benignimizers  a drug that makes the victim helplessly benevolent  Events spiral out of control at the Hilton  which was already so chaotic that charred corpses from bombing attacks would be covered with tarps where they lay while guests went about their business  The government ends up bombing the hotel  and Tichy escapes into the sewer where rats walk around on their hind legs  Tichy is evacuated from the scene by the military  but during his rescue the helicopter crashes and he awakes in the hospital  where he finds that his brain has been transplanted into the body of an attractive young black woman  Protesters attack the hospital  and Tichy is nearly killed again  This time when he wakes up  he finds he has been transplanted into the body of an overweight  red haired man  Tichy mental state grows increasingly fragile as he cannot distinguish reality from hallucination  and the medical staff make the decision to freeze him until a time when medicine can help his condition  He awakes in the year 2039  and at this point  the novel adopts the format of a journal that Tichy keeps to chronicle his experience in this new world  His future shock is so great that he finds he is being introduced to the world in small stages by the medical staff  In most regards  this future society is Utopian  Money is no object  One can simply go to the bank and request any sum and borrow it interest free  There is no effort made to collect the debt  either  as most people take a drug that instills a sense of pride and work ethic  which would disallow defaulting on the debt  Tichy learns that there is an inherent bias against defrostees  and that there are a great deal of words that he does not understand  Like cityspeak  and many other sci fi futuristic languages  it is a mishmash of words with clear enough English roots  though Tichy is mystified by it  Also  mood is highly regulated via drugs  Tichy gets involved with a woman  and during an argument  she deliberately takes a drug called recriminol to make her more combative  which prolongs the tiff  Following their break up  Tichy becomes deeply disillusioned with the 'psychem' mentality wherein drugs regulate every waking moment of the day  He resolves to stop taking any drugs and confides to his friend  Professor Trottelreiner  that he can not stand this new world  Trottelreiner explains that the everyday drugs that Tichy is tired of are only the tip of the iceberg  Narcotics and hallucinogens are trifles compared to 'mascons'  which are so powerful that they mask whole swaths of reality  Trottelreiner explains  mascon derives from mask  masquerade  mascara  By introducing properly prepared mascons to the brain  one can mask any object in the outside world behind a fictitious image‚Äîsuperimposed‚Äîand with such dexterity  that the psychemasconated subject cannot tell which of his perceptions have been altered  and which have not  If but for a single instant you could see this world of ours the way it really is‚Äîundoctored  unadulterated  uncensored‚Äîyou would drop in your tracks! The Professor then gives Tichy a flask of up'n'at'm  one of the vigilanimides  a powerful countersomniac and antipsychem agent  A derivative of dimethylethylhexabutylpeptopeyotine  With his first sip of up'n'at'm  Tichy watches as the gilded surroundings of the five star restaurant they are in evaporates into a dingy concrete bunker and his stuffed pheasant turns into 'the most unappetizing gray brown gruel  which stuck in globs to my tin ‚Äî no longer silver ‚Äî fork'  But this first dose is just the beginning of Tichy journey  He sees that people do not drive cars or ride in elevators  but they run in the streets and climb the walls of empty elevator shafts  which explains why everyone in this new world is so out of breath  Robots whip people in the street and protect order  Through successive doses of up'n'at'm  Tichy sees increasingly horrible visions of the world  climaxing in a frozen horrorscape where people sleep blissfully in the snow and the police robots are revealed to be people who are convinced they are robots  The frozen state of the world explains why he has always found the new world to be so cold  In a state of panic  Tichy realizes that he is no longer safely inside the illusion  but shipwrecked in reality  and he desperately seeks the seat of power  He ascends in a skyscraper to encounter his acquaintance George P  Symington Esquire  who sits in a modest office and explains to Tichy that he and a few others employ mascons as a way of maintaining order: The year is 2098     with 69 billion inhabitants legally registered and approximately another 26 billion in hiding  The average annual temperature has fallen four degrees  In fifteen or twenty years there will be glaciers here  We have no way of averting or halting their advance ‚Äî we can only keep them secret  I always thought there would be ice in hell  I said  Tichy realizes his only course of action and tackles Symington  pushing them both out of the window  They plummet to the earth  but instead of colliding with the frozen ground  Tichy splashes into the black  stinking waters of the sewer beneath the Costa Rica Hilton  where he realizes that it is now the second day of the Eighth World Futurological Congress ,1,0,0,0,0

Ernest Newboy  a famous poet visiting Bellona by invitation of Roger Calkins  publisher and editor of the local newspaper  The Bellona Times; Madame Brown  a psychotherapist; and  later in the novel  Captain Michael Kamp  an astronaut who  some years before  was in the crew of a successful moon landing  The notebook Kid receives already has writing throughout  but only on the right hand pages  The left hand pages are blank  Glimpses of the text in the notebook  however  are extremely close to passages in Dhalgren itself  as if the notebook were an alternate draft of the novel  Other passages are verbatim from the final chapter of Dhalgren  It is here in Chapter II that Kid begins using the blank pages of the notebook to compose poems  The novel describes the process of creating the poems‚Äîthe emotions and the mechanics of the writing itself‚Äîat length and several times  We never see the actual poems  however  in their final form  Kid soon corrects any line that appears to a form we do not read‚Äîor removes it entirely from the text  The third and longest chapter  House of the Ax  involves Kid interactions with the Richards family: Mr  Arthur Richards  his wife Mary Richards  their daughter June (who had been questionably raped publicly by George Harrison  whom she is now fixated on)  and son Bobby  Through Madame Brown they hire Kid to help them move from one apartment to another in the all but abandoned building of co ops  The Labry Apartments  in which they live  All but dysfunctional  they are nevertheless keeping up appearances  Mr  Richards leaves every day to go to work‚Äîthough no office or facility in the city seems to be in operation‚Äîwhile Mrs  Richards acts as though there is nothing truly disastrous happening in Bellona  By some force of will  she causes almost everyone who comes into contact with her to play along  Kid interactions with the Richardses culminates in the death of one of the family members  The third chapter is also where Ernest Newboy  a well known poet visiting Bellona  befriends Kid  Newboy takes an interest in Kid poems and mentions them to Roger Calkins  By the end of the chapter  Calkins is about to publish Kid poems  As the novel progresses  Kid falls in with the scorpions  a loose knit gang  three of whom have severely beaten him earlier in the book  Almost accidentally  Kid becomes their leader  Denny  a 15 year old scorpion  becomes Kid and Lanya lover  so that the relationship with Lanya turns into a lasting three way sexual linkage  Kid also begins writing things other than poems in the notebook  keeping a journal of events and his thoughts  In Chapter VI  Palimpsest  the novel penultimate chapter  Calkins throws a party for Kid and his book  Brass Orchids  at Calkins sprawling estate  At Calkins suggestion  Kid brings along twenty or thirty friends: the scorpion nest  While Calkins himself is absent from the gathering  the descriptions of the various interactions between Bellona high society (or  rather  what is left of it) and what can only be described as a street gang (the scorpions) is a section of the novel that often garners particular attention from reviewers and critics  This is also the part of the novel where Kid is interviewed by William (later passages of the book suggest William last name is Dhalgren  but it is never confirmed)  In Chapter VII  The Anathemeta: a plague journal  the novel concluding chapter  bits of the whole now and again appear to be laid out  Shifting from the omniscient viewpoint of the first six chapters  this chapter comprises numerous journal entries from the notebook  all of which appear to be by Kid  Several passages from this chapter have  however  already appeared verbatim earlier in the novel when Kid reads what was already in the notebook‚Äîwritten when he received it  In this chapter rubrics run along beside many sections of the main text  mimicking the writing as it appears in the notebook  (In the middle of this chapter  a rubric running contains the following sentence: I have come to to wound the autumnal city ) Recalling Kid entry into the city  the final section contains a near paragraph for paragraph echo of his initial confrontation with the women on the bridge  This time  however  the group leaving is almost all male  and the person entering is a young woman who says almost exactly what Kid did himself at the beginning of his stay in Bellona  The story ends: But I still hear them walking in the trees: not speaking  Waiting here  away from the terrifying weaponry  out of the halls of vapor and light  beyond holland into the hills  I have come to As with Finnegans Wake  the unclosed closing sentence can be read as leading into the unopened opening sentence  turning the novel into an enigmatic circle ,1,0,0,0,0

he is moderately successful  but still not entirely confident in his ability to ward them off  Soon before the game against Ravenclaw  Harry broomstick is returned to him  and as Ron takes it up to the dormitory  he discovers evidence that Scabbers has been eaten by Crookshanks  Ron is furious at Hermione  Soon afterwards  Gryffindor plays Ravenclaw at Quidditch  Harry  on his Firebolt  triumphs  winning the game  Once all the students have gone to bed  Sirius Black breaks into Harry dormitory and slashes the curtain around Ron bed  Several days later  Hagrid invites Harry and Ron over for tea and scolds them for shunning Hermione on account of Scabbers and the Firebolt  They feel slightly guilty  but not terrible  Soon Harry  under his invisibility cloak  meets Ron during a Hogsmeade trip;

oddly  Crookshanks knows the secret knob to press to still the flailing tree  They move through an underground tunnel and arrive at the Shrieking Shack  They find that the black dog has turned into Sirius Black and is in a room with Ron  Harry  Ron  and Hermione manage to disarm Black  and before Harry can kill Black  avenging his parents' deaths  Professor Lupin enters the room and disarms him  Harry  Ron  and Hermione are aghast as Lupin and Black exchange a series of nods and embrace  Once the three students calm down enough to listen  Lupin and Black explain everything  Lupin is a werewolf who remains tame through a special steaming potion made for him by Snape  While Lupin was a student at Hogwarts  his best friends  James Potter  Sirius Black  and Peter Pettigrew  became Animagi (humans able to take on animal forms) so that they could romp in the grounds with Lupin at the full moon  They explain how Snape once followed Lupin toward his transformation site in a practical joke set up by Sirius  and was rescued narrowly by James Potter  At this moment  Snape reveals himself from underneath Harry dropped invisibility cloak  but Harry  Ron  and Hermione disarm him  rendering him unconscious  Lupin and Black then explain that the real murderer of Harry parents is not Black  but Peter Pettigrew  who has been presumed dead but really hidden all these years disguised as Scabbers  Lupin transforms Scabbers into Pettigrew  who squeals and hedges but ultimately confesses  revealing himself to be Voldemort servant  and Black to be innocent  They all travel back to Hogwarts  but at the sight of the full moon  Lupin  who has forgotten to take his controlling potion (the steaming liquid)  turns into a werewolf  Sirius Black responds by turning into the large black dog in order to protect Harry  Ron  and Hermione from Lupin  As Black returns from driving the werewolf into the woods  a swarm of Dementors approaches  and Black is paralyzed with fear  One of the Dementors prepares to suck the soul out of Harry  whose patronus charm is simply not strong enough  Out of somewhere comes a patronus that drives the Dementors away  Harry faints  Harry awakens in the hospital wing to hear Snape and Cornelius Fudge discussing the fact that Sirius Black is about to be given the fatal Dementor Kiss  Harry and Hermione protest  claiming Black innocence  but to no avail;

495,Gravity Rainbow,The plot of the novel is complex  containing over 400 characters and involving many different threads of narrative which intersect and weave around one another  The recurring themes throughout the plot are the V 2 rocket  interplay between free will and Calvinistic predestination  breaking the cycle of nature  behavioral psychology  sexuality  paranoia and conspiracy theories such as the Phoebus cartel and the Illuminati  Gravity Rainbow also draws heavily on themes that Pynchon had probably encountered at his work as a technical writer for Boeing  where he edited a support newsletter for the Bomarc Missile Program support unit  The Boeing archives are known to house a vast library of historical V 2 rocket documents  which were probably accessible to Pynchon  The novel is narrated by many distinct voices  a technique further developed in Pynchon much later novel Against the Day  The style and tone of the voices vary widely: Some narrate the plot in a highly informal tone  some are more self referential  and some might even break the fourth wall  Some voices narrate in drastically different formats  ranging from movie script format to stream of consciousness prose  The narrative contains numerous descriptions of illicit sexual encounters and drug use by the main characters and supporting cast  sandwiched between dense dialogues or reveries on historic  artistic  scientific  or philosophical subjects  interspersed with whimsical nonsense poems and allusions to obscure facets of 1940s pop culture  Many of the recurring themes will be familiar to experienced Pynchon readers  including the singing of silly songs  recurring appearances of kazoos  and extensive discussion of paranoia  According to Richard Locke  megalomaniac paranoia is the operative emotion behind the novel  and an increasingly central motivator for the many main characters  In many cases  this paranoia proves to be vindicated  as the many plots of the novel become increasingly interconnected  revolving around the identity and purpose of the elusive 00000 Rocket and Schwarzger√§t  The novel becomes increasingly preoccupied with themes of Tarot  Paranoia  and Sacrifice  All three themes culminate in the novel ending  and the epilogue of the many characters  The novel also features the character Pig Bodine  of Pynchon novel V   Pig Bodine would later become a recurring avatar of Pynchon complex and interconnected fictional universe  making an appearance in nearly all of Pynchon novels thereafter  The novel also shares many themes with Pynchon much later Against the Day; Against The Day becomes increasingly dark as the plot approaches World War I  and Gravity Rainbow takes these sentiments to their extreme in its highly pessimistic culmination of World War II  The opening pages of the novel follow Pirate Prentice  first in his dreams  and later around his house in wartime London  Pirate then goes to work at ACHTUNG  a top secret military branch  with Roger Mexico and Pointsman  who both worked there at the time  It is here the reader is introduced to the possibly promiscuous US Army lieutenant named Tyrone Slothrop (at certain points in the book  Pynchon leads the reader to doubt the very existence of the women Slothrop claims to sleep with)  whose erratic story becomes the main plot throughout most of the novel  In Beyond The Zero  some of the other characters and organizations in the book note that each of Slothrop sexual encounters in London precedes a V 2 rocket hit in the same place by several days  Both Slothrop encounters and the rocket sites match the Poisson Distributions calculated by Roger Mexico  leading into reflections on topics as broad as Determinism  the reverse flow of time  and the sexuality of the rocket itself  Slothrop meets a woman named Katje  and they fall in love  maintaining a relationship until Slothrop sudden removal to Germany in part three  Many characters not significant until later are introduced in Beyond the Zero  including Franz and Leni P√∂kler  Roger Mexico and Jessica  and Thomas Gwenhidwy  some of whom do not appear until the closing pages of the novel  Many characters are introduced into the plot and then do not appear again at all  Indeed  most of the four hundred named characters only make singular appearances  serving merely to demonstrate the sheer scope of Pynchon universe  Slothrop is also submitted to various psychological tests  many involving the drug Sodium Amytal  Pavlovian conditioning is a recurring topic  mostly explored through the character of Pavlovian researcher Pointsman  One of the more bizarre Pavlovian episodes involves the conditioning of octopus Grigori to respond to the girl Katje  Early in part two  the octopus attacks Katje on the beach  and Slothrop is conveniently at hand to rescue her  Their romance begins here  extending into Part Three and the events that follow  In part two  Un Perm' au Casino Hermann Goering  Slothrop is studied covertly and sent away by superiors in mysterious circumstances to the Hermann G√∂ring casino in recently liberated France  in which almost the entirety of Part Two takes place  There he learns of a rocket  with the irregular serial number 00000 (Slothrop comments that the numbering system does not allow for four zeroes in one serial  let alone five)  and a component called the S Ger√§t (short for Schwarzger√§t  which translates to black device) which is made out of the hitherto unknown plastic Imipolex G  Several companions suddenly disappear or re appear after extended amounts of time  including the two guards watching Slothrop and Katje  It is hinted at that Slothrop prescience of rocket hits is due to being conditioned as an infant by the creator of Imipolex G  Laszlo Jamf  Later  the reality of this story is called into question in a similar fashion as the existence of Slothrop original sexual exploits were  After getting this information  Slothrop escapes from the casino into the coalescing post war wasteland of Europe  The Zone  searching for the 00000 and S Ger√§t  In the closing of Part Two  Katje is revealed to be safe in England  enjoying a day at the beach with Roger Mexico and Jessica  as well as Pointsman  who is in charge of Slothrop furtive supervision  While unable to contact Slothrop (or prohibited from contacting him)  Katje continues to follow his actions through Pointsman  Slothrop quest continues for some time In The Zone as he is chased by other characters  Many of these characters are referred to as shadows  and are only partially glimpsed by the protagonist  Much of the plot takes place on The Anubis  a ferry on which many different characters travel at various times  Slothrop meets and has an extended relationship with Margherita Erdman  a pornographic film actress and masochist  Originally meeting her in an abandoned studio in The Zone  it is she who leads him on to the Anubis  Here  Slothrop later also has extended encounters with her twelve year old daughter Bianca  though it is unclear whether or not he has stopped his casual relationship with Margherita by this time  Margherita is later shown to know a great deal more about the 00000  S Ger√§t  and Imipolex G than she lets on  even having spent many days in a mysterious and ambiguously described factory and being clothed in an outfit made from the erotic plastic  Towards the end of this section  several characters not seen since early in the novel make a return  including Pirate Prentice  in his first appearance since the novel very start  as well as Roger Mexico  In The Zone also contains the longest episode of the book  a lengthy tale of Franz P√∂kler  a rocket engineer unwittingly set to assist on the S Ger√§t production  The story details P√∂kler annual meetings with his daughter Ilse  and his growing paranoia that Ilse is really a series of impostors sent each year to mollify him  Through this story  we find out sparse details about the S Ger√§t  including that it has an approximate weight of forty five kilograms  The story ultimately reveals that the 00000 was fired in the spring of 1945  close to the end of the war  Slothrop spends much of the time as his invented alter ego Rocketman  wearing an operatic Viking costume with the horns removed from the helmet  making it look like a rocket nose cone  Rocketman completes various tasks for his own and others' purposes  including retrieving a large stash of hashish from the centre of the Potsdam Conference  This continues until he leaves the region for northern Germany  continuing his quest for the 00000  as well as answers to his past  It becomes steadily apparent that Slothrop is somehow connected to Dr  Laszlo Jamf  and a series of experiments performed on him as a child  Slothrop later returns to the Anubis to find Bianca dead  a possible trigger for his impending decline  He continues his pilgrimage through northern Germany  at various stages donning the identities of a Russian colonel and mythical Pig Hero in turn  in search of more information on his childhood and the 00000  Unfortunately  he is repeatedly sidetracked until his persona fragments totally in part four  despite the efforts of some to save him  Throughout The Counterforce  there are several brief  hallucinatory stories  of superheroes  silly Kamikaze pilots  and immortal sentient lightbulbs  These are presumed to be the product of Slothrop finally collapsed mind  The final identification of him of any certainty is his picture on the cover of an album by obscure English band The Fool (another allusion to Tarot  which becomes increasingly significant)  where he is credited as playing the Harmonica and Kazoo  At the same time  other characters' narratives begin to collapse as well  with some characters taking a bizarre trip through Hell  and others flying into nothingness on Zeppelins  A variety of interpretations of this fact exist  including theories that all of the involved characters have a shared consciousness  or even that the other characters are part of Slothrop mind  and thus disintegrate along with it  Slothrop narrative ends a surprisingly long time before the novel end  which focuses more on the 00000  and the people associated with its construction and launch (namely Blicero  Enzian  and Gottfried  amongst others)  At this point  the novel also concludes many characters' stories  including those of Mexico  Pointsman  and Pirate  leaving only the 00000  As the novel closes  many topics are discussed by the various protagonists around the world  ranging from Tarot cards to Death itself  Towards the end of The Counterforce  it transpires that the S Ger√§t is actually a capsule crafted by Blicero to contain a human  The story of the 00000 launch is largely told in flashbacks by the narrator  while in the present Enzian is constructing and preparing its successor  the 00001 (which isn't fired within the scope of the novel)  though it is unknown who is intended to be sacrificed in this model  In the flashbacks  the maniacal Captain Blicero prepares to assemble and fire the 00000  and asks Gottfried to sacrifice himself inside the rocket  He launches the rocket in a pseudo sexual act of sacrifice with his bound adolescent sex slave Gottfried captive within its S Ger√§t  At the end of a final episode  told partially in second person  the rocket descends upon Britain  The text halts  in the middle of a song composed by Slothrop ancestor  with a complete obliteration of narrative as the 00000 lands (or is about to land) on a cinema  Thus the novel opens and closes in wartime Britain  and opens and closes with the landing of a V 2 rocket  Many facts in the novel are based on technical documents relating to the V 2 rockets  Equations featured in the text are correct  References to the works of Pavlov  Ouspensky  and Jung are based on Pynchon research  The firing command sequence in German that is recited at the end of the novel is also correct and is probably copied verbatim from the technical report produced by Operation Backfire  In reality  a V 2 rocket hit the Rex Cinema in Antwerp  where some 1200&nbsp;people were watching the movie The Plainsman  on December 16  1944  killing 567&nbsp;people  the most killed by a single rocket during the entire war  The secret military organizations practicing occult warfare have an historical backdrop in the Ahnenerbe and other Nazi mysticism  whereas the allied counterparts were limited to certain individuals such as Louis de Wohls work for MI5  Additionally  the novel uses many actual events and locations as backdrops to establish chronological order and setting within the complex structure of the book  Examples include the appearance of a photograph of Wernher Von Braun in which his arm is in a cast  Historical documents indicate the time and place of an accident which broke Von Braun arm  thereby providing crucial structural details around which the reader can reconstruct Slothrop journey  Another example is the inclusion of a BBC Radio broadcast of a Benny Goodman performance  the contents of which  according to historical record  were broadcast only once during the period of the novel and by which the events immediately surrounding its mention are fixed  Further historical events  such as Allied bombing raids on Peenem√ºnde and the city of Nordhausen (close to the V 2 producing concentration camp Mittelbau Dora) also appear in the novel and help to establish the relation of the work

499,The Chrysalids,A few thousand years in the future  post apocalypse rural Labrador has become a warmer and more hospitable place than it is at present  The inhabitants of Labrador have vague historical recollections of the Old People  a technologically advanced civilization which existed long ago and which they believe was destroyed when God sent Tribulation to the world to punish their forebears' sins  The society that has survived in Labrador is loosely reminiscent of the American frontier during the 18th century  The inhabitants practise a form of fundamentalist Christianity with post apocalyptic prohibitions  They believe that in order to follow God word and prevent another Tribulation  they need to preserve absolute normality among the surviving humans  plants and animals  Genetic invariance has been elevated to the highest religious principle  and humans with even minor mutations are considered Blasphemies and the handiwork of the Devil  Individuals not conforming to a strict physical norm are either killed or sterilized and banished to the Fringes  a lawless and untamed area still rife with animal and plant mutations  Arguments occur over the keeping of a tailless cat or the possession of over sized horses  These are deemed by the government to be legitimate breeds either pre existing or achieved through conventional breeding  The government position is considered both cynical and heretical by many of the orthodox frontier community  The inland rural settlement of Waknuk is a frontier farming community  populated with hardy and pious individuals intent on reclaiming land from the Fringes  Ten year old David Strorm  the son of Waknuk zealous religious patriarch  has inexplicably vivid dreams of brightly lit cities and horseless carts that are at odds with his pre industrial experience  Despite David rigorous religious training  he befriends Sophie  a girl carefully concealing the fact that she has six toes on each foot  With the nonchalance of childhood David keeps her secret  The subsequent discovery of Sophie mutation and her family attempted flight causes David to wonder at the brutal persecution of human Blasphemies and the ritual culling of animal and plant Deviations  David and a few others of his generation harbour their own invisible mutation: they have strong telepathic abilities  David begins to question why all who are different must be banished or killed  As they mature  David and his fellow telepaths realize that their unusual mutation would be considered a blasphemy and they carefully conceal their abilities  That their mutation cannot be directly detected allows their unusual abilities to remain undiscovered for a time  Eventually some of the group are exposed and David  his half cousin Rosalind and younger sister Petra flee to the Fringes  They are quickly pursued not only by a group of villagers bent on doing them harm but also by Michael  a fellow telepath who covertly assists their escape  Through the extremely strong telepathic abilities of Petra they make contact with a more advanced society in distant Sealand  David  Rosalind and Petra elude their would be captors and are rescued by a Sealand expedition sent to discover the source of Petra telepathic transmissions  Due to limited space and fuel on the Sealand craft  Michael and his partner Rachel remain behind  their true nature undiscovered  Though the nature of Tribulation is not explicitly stated  it is implied that it was a nuclear holocaust  both by the mutations  and by the stories of sailors who report blackened  glassy wastes to the south west where the remains of faintly glowing cities can be seen (presumably the east coast of the US)  Sailors venturing too close to these ruins experience symptoms consistent with radiation sickness  A woman from Sealand  a character with evident knowledge of the Old People technology  mentions the power of gods in the hands of children ,1,0,0,0,0
500,Who Goes There ,A group of scientific researchers  isolated in Antarctica by the nearly ended winter  discover an alien spaceship buried in the ice  where it crashed twenty million years before  They try to thaw the inside of the spacecraft with a thermite charge  but end up accidentally destroying it when the ship magnesium hull is ignited by the charge  However  they do recover the alien pilot from the ancient ice  which the researchers believe was searching for heat when it was frozen  Thawing revives the alien  a being which can assume the shape  memories  and personality of any living thing it devours  while maintaining its original body mass for further reproduction  Unknown to them  the alien immediately kills and then imitates the crew physicist  a man named Connant; with some 90 pounds of its matter left over it tries to become a sled dog  The crew discovers the dog Thing and kills it in the process of transformation  Pathologist Blair  who had lobbied for thawing the Thing  goes insane with paranoia and guilt  vowing to kill everyone at the base in order to save mankind; he is isolated within a locked cabin at their outpost  Connant is also isolated as a precaution and a rule of four is initiated in which all personnel must remain under the close scrutiny of three others  The crew realizes they must isolate themselves and therefore disable their airplanes and vehicles  while pretending things are normal over their radio transmissions to prevent any rescue attempt from civilization  The researchers try to figure out who may have been replaced by the alien (simply referred to as the Thing)  in order to destroy the imitations before they can escape and take over the world  The task is almost impossibly difficult when they realize that the Thing is also telepathic  able to read minds and project thoughts  A sled dog is conditioned by human blood injections to provide a human immunity serum test  as in rabbits  The initial test of Connant is inconclusive as they realize that the test animal received both human and alien blood  meaning that either Doctor Copper or expedition Commander Garry is actually an alien  Assistant commander McReady takes over and deduces that all the other animals at the station  save the test dog  have already become imitations; all are killed by electrocution and their corpses burned  Everyone suspects each other by now but must stay together for safety  deciding who will take turns sleeping and speculating when the patient monsters will finally have the upper hand  Tensions mount and some men begin to go mad thinking they are already the last human or wondering if they would even know if they weren't human any longer  Ultimately  one of the crew members is murdered and accidentally revealed to be a Thing  McReady realizes that even small pieces of the creature will behave as independent  selfish organisms  He then uses this weakness to test which men have been converted by taking blood samples from everyone and dipping a heated wire in the vial of blood  Each man blood is tested  one at a time  and the donor is immediately killed if his blood recoils from the wire; fourteen in all  including Connant and Garry  are revealed as aliens  They go to test the isolated Blair and on the way see the first albatross of the Antarctic Spring flying overhead; they shoot the bird to prevent a Thing from taking it over and flying to civilization  When they reach Blair cabin they discover he is a Thing  They realize that it has been left to its own devices for a week  coming and going as it pleased  able to transform itself by squeezing under doors  With the creatures inside the base destroyed  McReady and two others enter the cabin to kill the Thing that was once Blair  McReady systematically forces it out into the snow and methodically destroys it with a blowtorch  Afterwards the trio discover that the Thing was dangerously close to finishing construction of an atomic powered anti gravity device that would have allowed it to escape to the outside world  No  by the grace of God  who evidently does hear very well  even down here  and the margin of half an hour  we keep our world  and the planets of the system too  Anti gravity  you know  and atomic power  Because They came from another sun  a star beyond the stars  They came from a world with a bluer sun ,1,0,0,0,0

Maurice gained it after eating one of the rats  before he was capable of realizing that they were no longer normal rats  The group is not completely happy; the leader of the rats  Hamnpork  despises Maurice  while Dangerous Beans (they chose names based on the labels they could read before they could comprehend)  a near blind albino rat who guides them like a guru  wants to start a rat civilization   both he and Peaches  the group scribe  find their trickery unethical  The rats are seeking the ideal of humans and rats living together  following the example of their sacred book Mr Bunnsy Has an Adventure  They agree to do one last job  in the town of Bad Blintz  in √úberwald  The rats set about planning their offensive  led by Darktan  the head of the Trap Disposal Squad  while Maurice and Keith look around  They are surprised to find that while the buildings are expensively built  the people have little food  and rats are hunted far more viciously than anywhere else  Maurice and Keith meet Malicia  the mayor daughter  who is a story teller  She soon discovers that Maurice can talk  and meets Sardines  a tap dancing rat who is the most daring of the group  While talking to her  Maurice reveals that the rat catchers have been passing off bootlaces as rat tails  As they set off to look in the rat catchers' house  the rats discover many rat tunnels  which are empty  save for traps and poison  The two groups meet in the rat catchers' den  where they have been storing the food the rats are thought to have eaten  and find cages where the rats are being bred for coursing  The rat catchers return  lock Keith and Malicia away  and take Hamnpork to be coursed  Maurice hides and feels a voice trying to enter his mind  The rats feel it too  and it returns many of them to being simple rats   to the dismay of Dangerous Beans  Darktan leads a group to rescue Hamnpork  while Peaches and Dangerous Beans free Keith and Malicia  Malicia lets slip that Mr Bunnsy Has an Adventure is a fictional children book and Dangerous Beans and Peaches leave in despair  Darktan group is successful in rescuing a severely injured Hamnpork  though Darktan finds himself in a trap  After a near death experience  he escapes  Hamnpork dies  Darktan assumes leadership and sets out after Dangerous Beans and Peaches  Maurice gives in to his conscience and is also seeking them  but the voice drowns out his thoughts  Malicia and Keith  after gaining freedom  trick the rat catchers into revealing their secret  The rat catchers have created a powerful rat king named Spider ‚Äì eight rats  tied together at the tail  who make a single mind with power over others  Spider is interested in Dangerous Beans; other rats he can control  but Dangerous Beans has a mind similar to his: one that thinks for others  Dangerous Beans refuses Spider offer of jointly ruling  as Spider wants to wage war on humans  Spider tries to destroy Dangerous Beans' mind; this is felt by his army of rats and Maurice  Dangerous Beans is able to resist  but Maurice reverts to being a cat  and the cat instinct tells him to pounce    Darktan army  who have been fighting Spider rats  find Peaches in Spider lair  which is on fire  Maurice emerges from the fire carrying the body of Dangerous Beans  When he is safely out  he collapses and dies  In ghostly form  he sees the Death of Rats coming for Dangerous Beans  He attacks the Death of Rats to save Dangerous Beans  but is picked up by Death  with whom he strikes a deal  exchanging two of his remaining lives so that Death will let Dangerous Beans live  Though Spider is defeated  there is still a problem remaining: the rat piper is due to arrive the next day  The rats set about rounding up the 'keekees' (non intelligent rats)  When the piper arrives  Keith challenges him to a duel  His pipe was broken by the rat catchers  so Keith uses a borrowed trombone in the duel and makes Sardines dance  When the piper starts to play his magical pipe  the rats avoid being charmed by keeping their ears stuffed and the keekees can not respond  being locked in their cages  The piper calls Keith aside  and tells him the tricks of the trade: the pipe contains a hidden slide position for a trick note that drives rats away  the stories about him are made up so people will be scared into paying  Keith and the piper then lead the keekees out of town ‚Äì Keith wants to maintain the story of the piper and the rats want a convenient way to set the keekees free  Once that has been done  the rats emerge  offering to tell the humans where to find the stolen food and money  in return for living peacefully with them  Keith stays on as the town piper and the town becomes a tourist attraction where everybody remarks on how 'clean' the place is and marvels at the 'well trained rats'  Maurice moves on  being unwilling to settle in one place at a time  and looks to find another human to 'coach' ,0,1,0,0,0
505,Permutation City,The plot of Permutation City follows the lives of several people in a near future reality where the Earth is ravaged by the effects of climate change  the economy and culture are largely globalised (the most commonly used denomination of currency is the ECU  the precursor to the euro in use at the time the book was written)  and civilisation has accumulated vast amounts of cloud computing power and memory which is distributed internationally and is traded in a public market called the QIPS Exchange (QIPS from MIPS  where the Q is Quadrillions)  Most importantly  from the perspective of the story  this great computing capacity is used to construct physiological models of patients for medical purposes  reducing the need for actual medical experimentation and enabling personalised medical treatments  but also enabling the creation of Copies  whole brain emulations of scanned humans which are detailed enough to allow for subjective conscious experience on the part of the emulation  Although not yet in widespread usage  scanning has become safe enough and common enough to allow for a few wealthy or dedicated humans to afford to create backups of themselves  generally with the intention of surviving the biological deaths of their bodies  A minority of Copies exist  though they are largely perceived (with some justification) as being a collection of the thanatophobic eccentric rich  Copies do not yet possess human rights under the laws of any nation or international body  although some of the wealthiest Copies  those still involved with their own estates or businesses  finance a powerful lobby and public relations effort to advance the Copy rights cause  To this effect  the legal status of Copies is viewed as somewhat farcical even by sceptics of the cause  and many expect full Copy rights to be granted in Europe within two decades  The plotline travels back and forth between the years of 2045 and 2050  and deals with events surrounding the life of a Sydney man named Paul Durham  who is obsessed  yet frustrated  with experimenting on Copies of himself (because he believes Copies of himself should be more willing to undergo experimentation)  In the latter time frame  Durham is suspected to be a con artist of some type  who travels around the world visiting rich Copies and offering them prime real estate in some sort of advanced supercomputer which  according to his pitch  will never be shut down and will be powerful enough to support any number of Copies in VR environments of their own designing at no slowdown whatsoever  no matter how preposterously opulent those environments might be  He pitches this concept to the Copies  predicated upon the prediction that the Copy rights movement might run into resistance due to devastating climate change  As the world undergoes increasingly extreme and erratic weather  a variety of international bodies  especially the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  which has been particularly hard hit by tropical storms  have proposed projects to use their vast computing resources to attempt to intervene  utilising chaotic effects to their advantage  in global weather patterns with such precision as to minimise weather related destruction while also minimising the scale of the efforts necessary to do so  Durham predicts this will clash with the spread of Copy rights  as both Copies and weather simulations will demand increasing QIPS Exchange shares in the future  All that each Copy must do is to make the laughably small investment of two million ecus in order to bring Durham fantasy computer into existence  As part of his plot  Durham hires Maria Deluca  an Autoverse enthusiast  She has recently become famous within the small community of Autoverse hobbyists for developing a variety of A  lamberti which evolved the capacity to metabolise an Autoverse toxin  Durham contacts her and offers to pay her thirty thousand dollars to design an Autoverse program which  given a large enough computer  could potentially evolve into a planet bearing Maria own strain of evolvable Autoverse life  She desperately wants the money to have her dying mother scanned into a Copy  Since no such computer to fully evolve Autoverse life exists  Durham has to try to convince Maria that he is a wealthy Autoverse enthusiast interested in her evolvability results and looking for a proof of concept for a much larger system  He also clandestinely commissions a famous virtual reality architect  Malcolm Carter  to build a full scale  high resolution VR city  Permutation City  the largest VR environment ever conceived  complete with reactive crowds and a staggering variety of full scale  high resolution scenic views  As computer fraud investigators begin to close in on Durham scheme  Maria is pressured by police into covertly gathering evidence in order to incriminate Durham  while continuing to work for him  She learns more about Durham himself  including his time spent in psychiatric care and his callous experimentation on his own Copies  as well as his assiduously reticent Copy backers  Meanwhile  two Slum dwelling Solipsist Nation Copies  Peer and Kate  explore their post human existences as well as their strained but loving relationship  until Kate long time friend Malcolm Carter offers to secretly hack them both  along with any moderately sized software packages they wish  into Permutation City machine code  guaranteeing them a place in the city were it ever to run  but permanently debarring them from manipulating the city implementation for fear of being deleted as extraneous cruft by automated software  At the end of Part One  Durham reveals the full extent of his plan to Maria: after taking his earlier self experiments to their logical conclusion  he became convinced of something he came to call the Dust Theory  which holds that there is no difference  even in principle  between physics and mathematics  and that all mathematically possible structures exist  among them our physics and therefore our spacetime  These structures are being computed  in the manner of a program on a universal Turing machine  using something Durham refers to as dust which is a generic  vague term describing anything which can be interpreted to represent information; and therefore  that the only thing that matters is that a mathematical structure be self consistent and  as such  computable  As long as a mathematical structure is possibly computable  then it is being computed on some dust  though it does not matter what dust actually is  only that there be a possible interpretation where such a computation is taking place somehow  The dust theory implies  as such  that all possible universes exist and are equally real  emerging spontaneously from their own mathematical self consistency  Due to the computability of consciousness and the function of consciousness as a matrix for interpretation  Copies hold the unique position of being the only conscious beings which themselves are not being computed by self consistent mathematical rules (existing  of course  in virtual realities held together by heuristics merely for the sake of their experience)  As such  in principle it should be the case that when a Copy is terminated and deleted  its own conscious experience will continue due to the fact that there is no precedent within the Copy interpretive matrix by which the Copy should suddenly cease  Indeed  Durham himself claims to have been through such a process several times  each time finding himself back in the real world after deletion  with there existing some plausible explanation as to why he believed himself to have been a Copy who was deleted  though with each successive experience of Copying himself and being deleted  he gradually became increasingly confident that the experiences were actually the result of his consciousness finding a logical interpretation in which it had not actually ceased  rather than each successive experience being ultimately true and real  Because of this  Durham is staging a massive  momentary buyout of the world processing power to simulate a minute or two of a Garden of Eden configuration of an infinitely expanding  massively complex cellular automaton universe (similar to what is known as a Spacefiller configuration in Conway Game of Life) based on a fictional  Turing complete cellular automaton known as TVC (Turing/Von Neumann/Chiang  named after its conceiver and designer)  in which each iteration of the expansion serves to manufacture an extra layer of blocks of a computing configuration  Ultimately  if a Copy were to be run in such a self consistent universe  and were to observe  via a series of pre defined experiments  the cellular nature of its own processing implementation  then there would be precedent for that self consistent TVC universe to persist in its own terms even after its termination and deletion in the universe it was designed and launched in  His and his investors' Copies would therefore persist indefinitely in the simulation  and since the space of the TVC universe would be made of self reproducing cellular automaton computer processors  the simulation would not possess a finite number of states and the passengers would not  in principle  run out of interesting things to get up to  Implanting himself and his investors in this TVC universe  Durham believed he could prove or falsify his hypothesis that his experience of repeated termination and continuation was the result of his own interpreting himself into universes in which he might plausibly have believed he had had such an experience  as opposed to merely having inhabited such a universe all along  If he were to implant his Copy into the TVC universe  have the copy run a number of experiments to anchor itself in that universe  and then terminate it  only to find himself still in the TVC universe (indeed  the purpose of growing the TVC universe from a Garden of Eden configuration was to prove to his Copy that such a TVC universe as it found itself to inhabit must have been launched from a non TVC universe  as opposed to merely having always existed and evolved towards this the current state in which he did not know whether it had) rather than back in the real world again  then he would be vindicated; if not  then his hypothesis would be falsified and he might consider himself crazy (his last several experiences of termination and subsequent continuation involved him finding himself in the position of having been recently cured of psychosis)  The Autoverse planetary seed program designed by Maria was to be included in the TVC universe package for his investors to explore once life had evolved there after it had been run on a significantly large segment of the TVC universe  Though Maria believes Durham to be obviously rationalising his experiences while psychotic  she agrees to Durham request to have herself scanned and inserted into the TVC launch as an on hand Autoverse expert  The six hundred thousand dollar fee will allow her mother to be scanned  and she is certain that her copy will never wake because she demands to be present at the launch to verify that her copy is not run during the launch period  and is subsequently deleted  After a successful launch  simulation  termination  and deletion of the TVC universe  Durham and Maria have uncomfortable sex in awkward celebration  and later that night  while Maria is asleep  Durham disembowels himself with a kitchen knife in his bathtub  believing his role as the springboard for his deleted TVC Copy to discover its true identity to be fulfilled  Maria wakes in Permutation City seven thousand years of subjective time after the launch  furious at Durham for being awoken and refusing to believe that the launch was successful  Durham eventually persuades her  however  by showing her the complexity of the Autoverse planet she had designed  Planet Lambert  which had then been running on a suitably large chunk of the TVC universe for several billion subjective years  Intelligent life in the form of complex swarms of insect like eusocial beings had evolved on Lambert from Maria original Autobacterium hydrophilus  and the citizens of Permutation City were on the verge of making contact with the creatures  However  a town hall vote restricted the Autoverse scholars from making contact until the creatures had independently hypothesized the existence of a creator  Meanwhile  Permutation City had flourished in the TVC universe  and the original inhabitants of a few hundred had exploded to a population of tens of thousands  with the descendants of the various founders sharing their founders' ever growing chunks of the TVC universe  with Permutation City acting as the central locus for interaction between populations located in different contiguous blocks of the universe  Durham  however  confides in Maria that he does not believe the insectoid creatures will ever seriously consider the concept of a creator and intends to use Maria slice of the universe processing power (as a founder of the world she was given de facto control of a continuously growing zone of the processor network as well) to make forbidden first contact with the life of Planet Lambert  He believes this is necessary because he has seemingly lost the ability to pause the Autoverse simulation or slow it down past a constant multiple of the size of the processor network it occupies  Durham is worried that the rules of their simulated universe are breaking down  What they discover together is that the growing and intellectually voracious population of Planet Lambert has exceeded the combined intelligence of the inhabitants of the remainder of the TVC universe  and that Lambert in its Autoverse has ceased to be defined as the TVC universe simulation  Rather  the Lambertians have been considering a new set of hypotheses  interpretations of the evidence present to them  which do not require their universe to have been created in Maria original Garden of Eden configuration  As such  the TVC universe processor networks  which had previously done the work of simulating the Autoverse for the inhabitants of Permutation City  were now progressively being redefined in ways which prevented them from interfering with the existence of the Autoverse in ways unprecedented under these newly self consistent interpretations of its terms of existence ‚Äì the TVC universe was being overwritten into a system existing solely as a byproduct of the self perpetuation of the Autoverse  and its inhabitants on Planet Lambert had interpreted it to be so  Durham  Maria  and some other companions quickly launch an emergency expedition into the Autoverse to attempt to convince the Lambertians of the validity of the creator hypothesis and its methodological perferentiality over their own newly formulated theory  Unfortunately  the Lambertians reject their presentation of the creator theory of the Autoverse on the grounds that a system such as the TVC universe  capable of simulating their own universe  would have to be infinitely sized or infinitely expanding  which they consider to be unparsimonious  Shortly after failing to convince Planet Lambert of the creator theory  the Lambertians inform them of the discovery a set of field equations with a stable solution for each of their universe elements; furthermore  initial studies on the equations show that they predict the spontaneous instantiation of matter at high temperatures  enabling their world to come into existence without requiring the Garden of Eden Maria had initially designed  To the alarm of its citizens  Permutation City and eventually the entire TVC processor network begins to collapse into nothingness  interpreted out of existence by the Lambertians whose reality no longer requires a maker  there being a 'better' solution that has superseded its possibility  As Permutation City becomes corrupted and the TVC universe begins to suffer spontaneous systemic failures  Durham and Maria inform the inhabitants of the various founders' computing blocks of the situation while preparing a new TVC Garden of Eden based on the original to launch in their universe final moments  though Durham initially declines to board it himself  saying he has become exhausted with the number of times he was awoken in new realities and would be unable to cope with experiencing it again  Ultimately  however  Maria

506,Strata, Kin Arad is a human planetary engineer working for the Company  a human organisation that builds habitable planets with techniques and equipment salvaged from the Spindle Kings  an extinct alien race  excelling in terraforming  The expressed aim of the Company planet building is to create branches of humanity diverse enough to ensure the whole species' survival for eternity  since the Earth population in the past has been decimated due to the lethal Mindquakes  epidemic mass deaths caused by too much homogeneity among the populace  All planets built by the Company are carefully crafted with artificial strata containing false fossils  indistinguishable from the real thing  On occasion  however  mischievous Company employees will attempt to place anomalous objects in the strata  like running shoes or other out of place artefacts as practical jokes  hoping to cause confusion among future archaeologists when the planets' beginnings have been long forgotten  The Company does not allow this however  and secretly monitors the generated strata in order to detect this  fearing such actions may cause the collapse of entire civilizations when the artefacts are eventually unearthed  Kin and two aliens  the four armed frog like  paranoid and muscular Kung Marco and Silver  a bear like Shand  historian and linguist by profession  are recruited by the mysterious Jago Jalo for an expedition  Jalo  a human who more than a thousand years ago embarked on a relativistic journey has made a stunning discovery   a flat Earth  However  when the team rendezvous on the Kung homeworld  the violent Jalo unexpectedly has an heart attack and dies  Shocked by the large amounts of weapons on board Jalo spaceship  Kin has misgivings about the expedition  but Silver and Marco see the possibility of reaping great technological rewards and launch the vessel  When the expedition finally arrives at Jalo pre programmed coordinates  they find a flattened version of the mediaeval Eastern hemisphere of Earth  clearly artificial  It rotates around its hub inside a gigantic hollow sphere with tiny stars affixed to the interior  complete with a small sun  moon and fake planets revolving around it  After their ship is hit by one of the orbiting planets  Kin  Marco and Silver are forced to abandon ship and land on the flat Earth with the help of their lift belt equipped suits  A return from the flat Earth now seems impossible  unless they are able to find its mysterious builders  so they embark on a journey to a structure they have spotted at the hub of the Disc  the only thing which does not match geographically with the Earth they know  En route  they encounter the superstitious Medieval inhabitants of the Disc  who believe the end of the world is near  due to increasingly chaotic climate (caused by the Disc machinery breaking down)  the recent disappearance of one of their planets and the general devastation caused by the ship crash  They also discover a number of other differences  What Kin Arad knows as Reme is called Rome on the Disc  and there is a strange Christos cult that is completely unfamiliar to Kin Arad  Also  Venus is conspicuously lacking its giant (lunar sized) moon Adonis  which dominates the sunset sky on the Earth Kin knows  and led humanity to a heliocentric world view early on  Since only the Eastern hemisphere of Earth is represented  the continent of America is completely missing; the travellers rescue a party of Vikings in the process of searching for Vinland  when their ship is about to sail over the edge of the world  In addition  there are real magical creatures and objects on the Disc  demons and magic purses and flying carpets   all of them  the travellers realise  highly advanced and sophisticated technological constructs like the Disc itself  Indeed  the world itself is an extremely old and sophisticated automated system  At the very end of the story  Kin comes to suspect that the builders of the flat world in fact constructed the universe as a whole  with the evidence of previous races being hoaxes and the flat world being an inside joke  analogous to the false strata Kin and the Company themselves manufacture  and the occasional hoaxes put in these strata by rebellious employees  Kin and the others eventually reach the hub and Kin makes contact with the Disc controlling systems  She is told that  despite advanced robotic maintenance  sheer entropy build up threatens the Disc further existence  The machines offer their advanced technology  in exchange for Kin construction of a real replacement Earth for the flat planet inhabitants  Kin agrees; the implication being that the world she will build is in fact our own Earth  Kin is excited about the massive task at hand; just like Ringworld Louis Wu  whom she parallels  she is over two hundred years old  and thus constantly under the threat of growing tired of life ,1,0,0,0,0

509,The Stand,The novel is divided into three parts  or books  The first is titled Captain Trips and takes place over nineteen days  with the escape and spread of a human made superflu (influenza) virus known formally as Project Blue  but most commonly as Captain Trips  The virus is developed at a United States  Army base  where it is accidentally released  While the base tries to shut down before any infected person can escape  a security malfunction allows a guard and his family to sneak out  Unfortunately  they are already infected  and set off a pandemic that kills an estimated 99 4% of the world human population  as well as that of domesticated animals  such as horses and dogs  Through the perspectives of the multiple principal characters  and also from an omniscient third party perspective  the narrative outlines the total breakdown and destruction of society through widespread violence  the failure of martial law to contain the outbreak  and eventually the death of virtually the entire population  The emotional toll is also dealt with  as the few survivors must care for their families and friends  dealing with confusion and grief as their loved ones succumb to the flu  The expanded edition opens with a prologue titled The Circle Opens that offers greater detail into the circumstances surrounding the development of the virus and the security breach that allowed its escape from the secret laboratory compound where it was created  Intertwining cross country odysseys are undertaken by a small number of survivors in three parties  which are drawn together by both circumstances and their shared dreams of a 108 year old woman from Hemingford Home  Nebraska  whom they see as a refuge and a representation of good in the struggle of good versus evil  This woman  Abagail Freemantle  or Mother Abagail  becomes the spiritual leader for the survivors  Mother Abagail directs them to Boulder  Colorado  where they struggle to re establish a democratic society  Meanwhile  another group of survivors are drawn to Las Vegas  Nevada by Randall Flagg  an evil being with supernatural powers who represents the Enemy  or the Adversary  Flagg‚Äôs governance is brutally tyrannical  using crucifixion  dismemberment and other forms of torture to quell dissent  Flagg group is able to quickly reorganize its society  restore power to Las Vegas  and rebuild the city with the many technical professionals who have migrated there  Flagg group launches a weapons program  searching the country for suitable arms  In Boulder  the democratic society of the Free Zone is beset with problems: Mother Abagail  feeling that she has become prideful due to her pleasure at being a public figure  disappears into the wilderness on a journey of spiritual reconciliation  The Free Zone leadership committee  consisting of seven men and women    Frannie Goldsmith  Stu Redman  Nick Andros  Larry Underwood  Ralph Brenter  Glen Bateman  and Susan Stern    decide to secretly send three people to Randall Flagg territory to act as spies  Meanwhile  one of the survivors  Harold Lauder  builds a dynamite bomb in response to feelings of disconnection and revenge for his unrequited love for Fran Goldsmith  who had fallen for Stu Redman; another survivor  Nadine Cross  seduced despite herself by Flagg dark attraction which first manifested itself to her years earlier via a ouija board  plants the bomb where it will effectively destroy the Free Zone leadership  The explosion kills Nick and Susan and several other Free Zone inhabitants  but the other members of the leadership committee manage to avoid the explosion due to Mother Abagail timely return  However  her body is ravaged with malnutrition  and she is dying  The stage is now set for the final confrontation as the two camps become aware of one another  and each recognizes the other as a threat to its survival  leading to the stand of good against evil  There is no pitched battle  however  Instead  at Mother Abagail dying behest  four of the five surviving members of the Boulder governing committee    Glen Bateman  Stu Redman  Ralph Brentner and Larry Underwood    accompanied by the dog Kojak set off on foot towards Las Vegas on an expedition to confront Randall Flagg  Stu breaks his leg en route and convinces the others to go on without him as they promised  telling them that God will provide for him if that what is meant to happen  The remaining three soon encounter Flagg men  who take them prisoner  When Glen Bateman rejects an opportunity to be spared if he kneels and begs Flagg for his life  he is shot and killed on Flagg orders by Lloyd Henreid  Flagg right hand man  Flagg gathers his entire collective to witness the execution of the two prisoners  but just as it is about to take place the Trashcan Man  an insane follower of Flagg who is somehow able to search out weapons of death  arrives with a nuclear warhead  Flagg magical attempt to silence a dissenter is transformed into a giant glowing hand ‚Äî The Hand of God ‚Äî which detonates the bomb  destroying Las Vegas and all of Flagg followers  along with Larry and Ralph  The inhabitants of Boulder anxiously anticipate the birth of Frances Goldsmith baby  aware of the implications to the human race if the baby lacks immunity to the superflu and dies  Soon after she gives birth to a live baby  Stu Redman returns to Boulder along with Kojak and Tom Cullen  one of the spies sent earlier by the Free Zone  who had rescued Stu while returning to the Free Zone  Although the baby  Peter  falls ill with the superflu  he is able to fight it off  The original edition of the novel ends with Fran and Stu questioning whether the human race can learn from its mistakes  The answer  given in the last line  is ambiguous: I don‚Äôt know  The expanded edition follows this with a brief coda called The Circle Closes  which leaves a darker impression and fits in with King‚Äôs ongoing wheel of ka theme  Randall Flagg  using the alias Russell Faraday  wakes up on a beach somewhere in the South Pacific  having escaped the atomic blast in Vegas by using his dark magic (although Flagg does not remember how he got to the beach or what his real name is  and it is suggested that he does not even remember the events in America)  There he begins recruiting adherents among a preliterate  dark skinned people  who worship him as some sort of god ,1,0,0,0,0

511,Diaspora,Diaspora begins with a description of orphanogenesis  the birthing of a citizen without any ancestors (most citizens descend from fleshers uploaded at some point)  and the subsequent upbringing of the newborn Yatima within Konishi polis  Yatima matures within a few real time days  because citizens' subjective time runs about 800 times as rapidly as flesher and gleisner time  Early on  Yatima and a friend  Inoshiro  use abandoned gleisner bodies to visit a Bridger colony near the ruins of Atlanta on Earth  Years later  the gleisner Karpal  using a gravitational wave detector  determines that a binary neutron star system in the constellation of Lacerta has collapsed  releasing a huge burst of energy  Previous predictions portrayed the system stable orbit as likely to last for another seven million years  By analysing irregularities in the orbit  Karpal discovers that the devastating burst of energy will reach Earth within the next four days  Yatima and Inoshiro return to Earth to urge the fleshers ‚Äî gathered in a conference ‚Äî either to migrate to the polises or at least to shelter themselves  Many fleshers reject this advice  or fail fully to appreciate its urgency quickly enough  Stirred up by a paranoid Static diplomat  many fleshers suspect that Yatima and Inoshiro have come to trick or coerce them into Introdus  or mass migration into the polises  involving masses of virus sized nanomachines which dismantle a human body and record the brain information states as it is chemically converted into a crystalline computer  The gamma ray burst reaches Earth shortly after the conference  destroying the atmosphere and causing a mass extinction  The gleisners and the Coalition of Polises survive the burst  thanks to cosmic radiation hardening  Over the next few years  Yatima and other citizens and gleisners attempt to rescue any surviving fleshers from slow suffocation  starvation  or poisoning by offering to upload them into the polises  The novel title itself refers to a quest undertaken by most of the inhabitants of Carter Zimmerman (C Z)  a polis devoted to physics and understanding the cosmos  along with volunteers from throughout the Coalition of Polises  The Diaspora consists of a collection of one thousand clones (digital copies) of C Z polis  deployed toward stars in all directions in the hope of gathering as much data as possible in order to revise the long held classical understanding of Kozuch Theory  which had failed to predict the Lacerta event  The bulk of the novel follows this expedition  rotating back and forth between different cloned instances of the same cast of main characters as different C Z clones make discoveries along the way  relaying information to one another over hundreds of light years ‚Äì and finally between universes ,1,0,0,0,0
512,Schild Ladder, Twenty thousand years in the future  Cass  a humanoid physicist from Earth  travels to Mimosa orbital station and begins a series of experiments to test the extremities of the fictitious Sarumpaet rules  a set of fundamental equations in Quantum Graph Theory  which holds that physical existence is a manifestation of complex constructions of mathematical graphs  However  the experiments unexpectedly create a bubble of something more stable than ordinary vacuum  dubbed novo vacuum  that expands outward at half the speed of light as ordinary vacuum collapses to this new state at the border  hinting at more general laws beyond the Sarumpaet rules  The local population is forced to flee to ever more distant star systems to escape the steadily approaching border  but since the expansion never slows  it is just a matter of time before the novo vacuum encompasses any given region within the Local Group  Two factions develop as the expanding bubble swallows star after star: the Preservationists  who wish to stop the expansion and preserve the Milky Way at any cost; and the Yielders  who consider the novo vacuum to be too important a discovery to destroy without understanding  Six hundred years after the initial experiment  aboard the Rindler  a vessel that has matched velocities with the border and is powered by multispectral light emitted as the ordinary vacuum collapses into its lower energy state  a variety of refugees are probing the novo vacuum in order to understand the physics that makes it possible  The novo vacuum turns out to be more complicated than anyone suspects  however  and Egan usual topics of simulation and quantum ontology are taken to the extreme when we learn that a whole ordered universe exists within this zone of apparent chaos  existing as direct elaborations of the quantum graph lattice structure  of which elementary particles  fundamental interactions  and our spacetime itself are only special cases ,1,0,0,0,0

515,The Gods Themselves,The main plotline is a project by aliens who inhabit a parallel universe (the para Universe) with different physical laws from this one  By exchanging matter with Earth  they seek to exploit these differences in physical laws  The exchange of matter provides an alternative source of energy in their dying Universe  However  the exchange of physical laws will have the ultimate result of turning the Earth Sun into a supernova  and possibly even turning a large part of the Milky Way into a quasar which  in turn  provides more energy for the para Universe  The first part takes place on Earth  Frederick Hallam  a scientist of limited ability but with a fiercely protective ego  discovers that an old container contents seem to have been altered  He initially accuses a colleague of tampering with his sample  and gets a snide remark in return  Hallam responds with a furious effort and eventually finds that the sample  originally tungsten  has been transformed into something that turns out to be plutonium 186‚Äîan isotope that cannot occur naturally in our universe  As this is investigated  Hallam makes the crucial suggestion that the matter has been swapped by beings in a parallel universe  This turns out to be correct and leads to the development of a cheap  clean  and apparently endless source of energy: the Electron Pump  which trades matter between our universe (where plutonium 186 decays into tungsten 186) and a parallel one governed by slightly different physical laws (where tungsten 186 turns into plutonium 186)  yielding a nuclear reaction in the process  The development process inextricably ties Hallam to the Pump in the minds of the people  vaulting him into an incredibly high position in public opinion and winning him power  position  and a Nobel Prize to boot  An idealistic young physicist  Lamont  while writing a history of the Pump  comes into conflict with Hallam and begins to question the official history of its discovery  Lamont is convinced that the development of the Pump was mainly due to the para men  who he believes are more intelligent; he notes the instructions they had sent early in the project (although only the diagrams  and not the linguistic parts  had been comprehensible)  Hallam is infuriated by the suggestion that his role is secondary  and destroys Lamont career  Lamont enlists the help of Bronowski  a linguist who had won renown for translating the Etruscan language and is looking for a new challenge  As Bronowski works on the para men old messages  Lamont discovers that the Pump is in fact creating a dangerous situation that could cause the Sun to become a nova (the pump increases the strong nuclear force inside the sun  causing the sun to fuse its hydrogen fuel more rapidly)  This would  incidentally  also doom the para world by accelerating the cooling of its own sun  Bronowski seems to be making some progress  receiving what appears to be an acknowledgment that the Pump may be dangerous  Lamont attempts to demonstrate this to a politician and several members of the scientific community  but they  seduced by the cheap  presumed clean energy source and unwilling to take Hallam on face to face for fear of suffering Lamont own fate  are unwilling to listen to him  Lamont decides that the only option now is to tell the para men that the Earth side agrees to stop  arguing that even if he is killed for it  he will eventually be a hero who saved the world  But then Bronowski reveals his last message which shows that they have in fact been in contact not with the para authorities but with para dissidents like himself  who cannot persuade their para Hallam  and are therefore   in a mirror image way   begging him to stop the Pump  There seems to be no way out  The second part takes place in the parallel universe  The aliens consist of the hard ones and the amorphous soft ones  The soft ones have three sexes with fixed roles for each sex: * Rationals   Called lefts  rationals are the logical and scientific sex  Rationals are identified with masculine pronouns and produce a form of sperm  * Emotionals   Called mids  emotionals are the intuitive sex  Emotionals are identified with the feminine pronouns and provide the energy needed for reproduction  * Parentals   Called rights  parentals bear and raise the offspring  Parentals are identified with masculine pronouns  All three 'genders' are embedded in sexual and social norms of expected and acceptable behavior  The hard ones regulate much of soft one society  among other things creating families by allocating one of each of the sexes to a mating group  or triad in the novel terminology  and acting as teachers and mentors to the Rationals  Little is shown of hard one society and Dua  the protagonist of this section of the book  suspects that the hard ones are a dying race since there are no hard one children  Her assumption is that the hard ones keep the soft ones as pets and toys  as a replacement for the children they do not have  This is dismissed by Odeen  the Rational of Dua triad  who having the most contact with the hard ones  has heard the hard ones speak of a new hard one called Estwald  Dua is an oddball Emotional who exhibits traits normally associated with Rationals  leading her to be called a left em  Interestingly  the companions in her triad are also revealed to be unusual and they too behave differently than what is expected from their appropriate sex  She learns about her universe end of the Pump  By engaging in teachings from Odeen  she also concludes on her own the supernova problem that Lamont uncovered in the first section; outraged that the Pump is allowed to continue to operate  despite the fact that it will eventually result in the destruction of another civilization  she attempts to put a stop to the project  She cannot persuade her own species to abandon the Pump  as they have no choice but to use it   their own sun as well as all the other stars in that universe are dying and can no longer provide the energy they need to continue to reproduce; their only other source of energy is the Pump  The majority decision is that  while their continued use of the Pump will destroy Earth and its solar system  abandoning it will result in their own extinction and thus cannot be done  While Lamont has assumed the destruction of Earth sun would be fatal for the para world  it turns out that in fact they would be able to draw energy off such a huge source directly without needing a Pump any more  and thus they would actually be safer once the Earth sun exploded  The differences in the laws of physics in the parallel universe mean that the aliens' bodies do not have the same material properties as living matter in this universe  Instead of consuming material that is then converted into energy  the aliens absorb it directly from sunlight  The different sexes can melt and merge physically  their analog of sex (the younger ones and some Emotionals can somehow overcome the repulsion between atoms and melt into walls  which is seen as a social taboo)  Rationals and Parentals can do this to some extent independently  but in the presence of an Emotional  they can become essentially immaterial and the melt becomes total  the three bodies coming together into one (which causes orgasmic sensations  but also results in blackout and memory loss during the melt)  Only during such a total melt can the Rational impregnate the Parental  with the Emotional providing the energy  Driven by an innate desire to procreate  Tritt  the Parental of the triad  at first asks Odeen to persuade Dua to facilitate the production of the third child  When this fails  Tritt steals an energy battery from the Pump and rigs it to feed Dua  She accepts it  as it coincides with her finally being taught by Odeen about physics (which violates the gender norms of this society   Odeen consulted his hard teacher about the problem of the third child  the teacher encouraged him to go with her abnormalities)  Filled with this energy  the triad mates  and Tritt becomes pregnant with their last child  Dua discovers this betrayal and escapes from her family to the caves of the hard ones where she is able to melt through the walls (which is possible because she retained her thinness by eating little in general)  Once there she begins a guerilla campaign to stop the Pump  transmitting the alternative messages that Lamont received in the first section  Eventually  her escape method of melting through walls and creating the metal messages cause her to lose too much of the energy needed to continue her existence  As she is about to expire  against all odds she is found by her triad  She is about to defy her triad by seeking to die anyway  but it is finally revealed that once a triad has produced at least one more triad of children to maintain a stable population  they are ready to fuse permanently into a single individual of the species fully mature form   the hard ones  In fact  they temporarily form this same individual whenever they melt  but have no memory of it afterward  This fact is kept carefully concealed by the mature population from the semi mature population  because the melt is also a mind meld  and it is important that the Rational of a triad become mature enough to understand the conditions of their existence by themselves  before the final melt into a mature hard one  Afraid that they will lose the Hard one formed by Dua triad  the hard ones have coached Odeen into realising the reality of the melt  All members of the triad are exceptional in their own way; Dua has learnt more about the other universe than any hard one  Odeen has shown greater intuition and empathy than a normal Rational  and Tritt has shown greater initiative and technical ability in stealing and setting up the lamp than any other Right  Odeen convinces Dua that the hard one that they will become will have influence with the hard ones to stop the Pump  As they are ready to pass on  in between thoughts of the daughter she will not know  Dua realizes that in fact the fusion of her triad had produced Estwald himself  the original inventor of the Pump  The third part of the novel takes place on the Moon  centering around a cynical middle aged physicist named Denison  briefly introduced in Part 1 as the colleague and rival of Hallam whose snide remark drove Hallam to invent the Pump  Denison  independently of Lamont  deduced the danger in the Electron Pump (although it was Lamont who discovered the final technical facts)  and goes on to find a solution that harms no one and greatly benefits humanity: he taps into yet another parallel universe  that exists in a pre big bang state (a cosmic egg or cosmeg)  where physical laws are different and  in fact  opposite to the ones in Dua universe  The exchange with the second parallel universe both produces more energy at little or no cost (which is a pleasant side effect for the Lunar residents  who had been unable to establish electron pumps)  and balances out the changes from the use of the Electron Pump  resulting in a return to equilibrium  Denison is helped by a Lunarian tourist guide named Selene Lindstrom  who is secretly an Intuitionist (a genetically engineered human with superhuman intuition)  In the end  Selene and Denison also foil a plot to use the new power source to move the moon out of earth orbit ,1,0,0,0,0
516,Howl Moving Castle, A young woman named Sophie Hatter is the eldest of three daughters living in the town of Market Chipping in the magical kingdom of Ingary  where many fairy tale tropes are accepted ways of life  She is very deft with the needle and makes the most beautiful hats and dresses  She unknowingly talks life into objects  As the eldest  she is resigned to the fact that she will have no chance of finding her fortune  accepting that she will have a dull life running the family hat shop&mdash;until she is turned into an old crone by the Witch of the Waste  a powerful witch who was not satisfied by Sophie hats  Sophie leaves the shop and finds work as a cleaning lady for the notorious Wizard Howl  famed in her town for eating the hearts of beautiful young women  Sophie strikes a bargain with Howl resident fire demon  Calcifer: if Sophie can break the contract between Howl and Calcifer  then Calcifer will return Sophie to her original form  Part of the contract  however  stipulates that neither Howl nor Calcifer can disclose the main clause of the contract to any third party  Sophie tries to guess the specifics of the contract  while Calcifer supplies frequent hints which Sophie usually does not pick up  Sophie soon learns that Howl  a rather self absorbed  dishonest and cavalier but ultimately good natured person (and an extraordinary wizard)  spreads these malicious rumours about himself to ensure his privacy and smear his own reputation to avoid work and responsibility  The door to his castle is actually a portal that opens onto four different places: the moving castle Sophie first encounters in the hills above Market Chipping  the seaside city of Porthaven  the royal capital of Kingsbury and Howl boyhood home in Wales  where he was named Howell Jenkins  Howl realizes that Sophie is under a spell and secretly attempts to remove the curse; when met with failure  he comes to the conclusion that Sophie simply enjoys being in disguise  Howl apprentice Michael Fisher runs most of the day to day affairs of Howl business  while Howl chases his ever changing paramours  Howl and Michael court Sophie two younger sisters Lettie and Martha  respectively  Martha  the youngest  was sent to study magic  while the middle sister  Lettie  was apprenticed at a local bakery  Disguising herself as Lettie  Martha arranged for the two of them to switch places  as Fanny (Martha mother and Sophie and Lettie stepmother) did not take their wishes into account when arranging their apprenticeships  When Prince Justin (the King younger brother) goes missing while searching for Wizard Suliman (Benjamin Sullivan  also from Wales)  the King orders Howl to find Suliman and Justin and kill the Witch of the Waste  Howl  however  has his own reasons to avoid seeking a confrontation with the Witch of the Waste; the Witch  a jaded former lover  has laid a curse on him  Howl attempts to weasel out of it by having Sophie  pretending to be his mother  petition against the appointment‚Äî but to no avail  Instead of blackening Howl name like he asked Sophie to do  she gets him appointed the new Royal Wizard  the post he has been trying to avoid for years  Howl continues to avoid the Witch of the Waste until she lures Sophie into a trap; believing that the Witch has taken Howl current love interest  Lily Angorian  captive  Sophie goes to save her and is in turn captured by the Witch of the Waste  Howl comes to save Sophie and defeats the Witch of the Waste  He knew all along that Miss Angorian was actually the Witch fire demon in disguise  The Witch fire demon had  over the years  taken control of the Witch and  once the Witch is defeated  tries to take Howl heart to stay alive  Howl is able to stop the demon but fails because Miss Angorian took hold of Calcifer and tried to squeeze Howl heart out of him  Sophie uses her talent of talking things to life to break the contract between Howl and Calcifer without killing either of them  Sophie has been unconsciously retaining the spell on herself  but her concern for Howl weakens the spell  and with the death of the Witch of the Waste  who was a significant force behind the spell as well  Calcifer  as promised  breaks the spell the second she concludes the contract between him and Howl  and she returns to her proper age  When Howl awakens  he destroys the witch fire demon  This breaks the curse on Wizard Suliman and Prince Justin  whom the Witch had fused together in an effort to create a 'perfect human' (Howl head was meant to complete the being) to use as a puppet to rule Ingary  Calcifer returns under the condition that he can come and go as he wishes  Sophie and Howl admit they love each other (without actually saying it) and Howl suggests they live happily ever after ,0,1,0,0,0

518,Mother Night,During the Nazi build up after Adolf Hitler seized power in 1933  Campbell decides to stay in Germany despite his parents' decision to leave  He continues to write plays  his only associations being with members of the ruling Nazi party as his social contacts  Being of sufficiently Aryan parentage  Campbell becomes a member of the Nazis in name only  He is politically apathetic  caring only for his art and his wife Helga  who is also the starring actress in all of his plays  The first part of the book ends after Campbell has an encounter on a park bench in the Berlin Zoo  While sitting on the bench he is approached by a man calling himself Frank Wirtanen  an agent of the United States  War Department  Wirtanen wants Campbell to spy for the United States  in the upcoming war  Campbell immediately rejects the offer  but Wirtanen quickly adds that he wants Campbell to think about it  He tells him that Campbell answer will come in the form of how he acts and what positions he assumes once the United States  and Germany declare war on each other  Once World War II starts  Campbell begins to make his way up through Joseph Goebbels' propaganda organization  eventually becoming the voice of broadcasts aimed at converting Americans to the Nazi cause  The spy part of the job comes in when he is transmitting his vitriolic messages; unbeknownst to the Nazis  all of the idiosyncrasies of his speech (deliberate pauses  coughing  etc ) are part of the coded information he is passing to the American Office of Strategic Services (the predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency)  Campbell never discovers  nor is he ever told (except in one notable instance)  the information that he is sending  About halfway through the war his wife goes to the eastern front to entertain the German troops  Campbell is extremely distraught when he hears that the camp where she had been entertaining in Crimea had been overrun and she was presumed dead  (In a much later exchange  Wirtanen reveals the sad truth; Campbell wife probable death was included in one of his own coded messages about a week before Campbell was told)  Right before the Soviet Army invades Berlin  Campbell visits his in laws one last time  Helga father had been chief of police in Berlin and tells Campbell that he never liked him  and had always thought that Campbell was a spy  He goes on to say though that even if he had been a spy  he had been so good at the propaganda business that he never could have served the other side better than he had served Nazi Germany  Campbell then has an exchange with Helga younger sister  Resi  that will resonate with him years later  Eventually  he is captured by United States  forces  Wirtanen works a deal in which Campbell is set free and then given passage to New York City  whence the rest of the action of the book takes place  In New York City  Campbell lives a lonely  anonymous life  sustained only by memories of his wife and an indifferent curiosity about his eventual fate  His only friend is George Kraft  a similarly lonely neighbor&mdash;who  through an extraordinary coincidence  also happens to be a Soviet intelligence agent  He tries to trick Campbell into fleeing to Moscow by publicizing the fact that Campbell has been living in New York since the end of the war  A white supremacist organization learns of his existence and makes him a cause celebre  inviting him to speak to new recruits as a true American patriot  The group leader  a dentist named Lionel Jones  shows up at Campbell apartment with a surprise: a woman claiming to be Helga  alive and well and professing her undying love  Campbell will to live returns for the first time in years  and remains even after he finds out that she is not Helga  but rather her younger sister Resi  They plan to escape to Mexico City after attending one of Jones' fascist meetings  There  Wirtanen makes an appearance to warn Campbell of Kraft plot  and of Resi complicity in it  Heartbroken  Campbell decides to go along with the charade  He confronts Kraft and Resi  the latter swearing her feelings for him are genuine  The FBI then raids the meeting and takes Campbell into custody  while Resi commits suicide by taking a cyanide capsule  As before  Wirtanen uses his influence to get Campbell set free  Once Campbell returns to his apartment  however  he realizes that he has no real reason to continue living  and decides to turn himself in to the Israelis to stand trial  The book ends as it began  with Campbell sitting in his Israeli jail cell waiting for his trial  Coincidentally  he meets Adolf Eichmann and gives him advice on how to write an autobiography  He then is transferred to a different holding cell where he further awaits his trial  At the very end of the book Campbell inserts a letter that he has just received from Wirtanen  The corroborating evidence that he was indeed an American spy during World War II has finally arrived  and Wirtanen writes that he will testify to Campbell true loyalties in court  Rather than being relieved  Campbell feels nauseated by the idea that he will be saved from death and granted freedom when he is no longer able to take pleasure in anything life has to offer  In the last lines Campbell tells us that he will hang himself not for crimes against humanity  but rather for crimes against himself  This is the only story of mine whose moral I know  I do not think it is a marvelous moral  I just happen to know what it is    Vonnegut So it goes nonchalance announces on the first page of the Introduction  The moral of the story appears again and throughout Mother Night from this point on  and Vonnegut periodically elaborates upon it after saying  We are what we pretend to be  so we must be careful about what we pretend to be  As a minor adjunct to this moral  Vonnegut later offers the observation that When you are dead  you are dead  The author then pauses and says  And yet another moral occurs to me now; Make love when you can  It is good for you ,1,0,0,0,0
519,The Forever War,William Mandella is a physics student conscripted for an elite task force in the United Nations Exploratory Force being assembled for a war against the Taurans  an alien species discovered when they apparently suddenly attacked human colonists' ships  The UNEF ground troops are sent out for reconnaissance and revenge  The elite recruits have IQs of 150 and above  are highly educated  healthy and fit  Training is gruellingfirst on Earth  in Missouri  and later on Charon (not Pluto moon  which had not yet been discovered at the time of the novel writing  but a hypothetical planet beyond Pluto orbit)  which results in a number of casualtiesmainly due to accidents in hostile environments but also due to the use of live weapons in training  The new soldiers then depart for action  traveling via wormhole like phenomena called 'collapsars' (called Black Holes today) that allow ships to cover thousands of light years in a split second  However  traveling to and from the collapsars at near lightspeed has massive relativistic effects  Their first encounter with (unarmed) Taurans on a planet orbiting Epsilon Aurigae turns into a massacre  with the unresisting enemy base wiped out  Mandella melancholically reflects on how typical the encounter was for humanity previous record in interaction with other cultures  This first expedition  beginning in 1997  lasted only two years from the soldier perspective  but due to time dilation  upon return to Earth decades have passed  On the long way home  the soldiers experience future shock first hand  as the Taurans employ increasingly advanced weaponry against them while they do not have the chance to re arm  Mandella  with soldier  lover and companion Marygay Potter  returns to civilian life  only to find humanity drastically changed  He and his fellow soldiers have difficulty fitting into a future society that has evolved almost beyond their comprehension  The veterans learn that to curb overpopulation  which led to worldwide class wars caused by inequitable rationing  homosexuality has become officially encouraged by many of the world nations  The world has become a very dangerous place due to widespread unemployment and the easy availability of deadly weapons  The changes within society alienate Mandella and the other veterans to the point where many re enlist to escape  even though they realize the military is a soulless construct  Mandella attempts to get an assignment as an instructor on Luna but is promptly reassigned by standing order to combat command  The inability of the military to treat its soldiers as more than highly complex valuable machines is a theme of the story  Almost entirely through luck  Mandella survives four subjectively experienced years of military service  which time dilation makes equivalent to several centuries  He soon becomes the objectively oldest surviving soldier in the war  attaining high rank through seniority  not ambition (he is essentially a pacifist and an eternally reluctant soldier  who acts mostly from talent and a melancholic sense of duty)  Despite this he is separated from Marygay (who has remained his last contact with the Earth of his youth) by UNEF plans  despite the fact that many of the people who he would command had not yet been born  As the commanding officer of a trike force'  Mandella commands soldiers who speak a language largely unrecognizable to him  whose ethnicity is now nearly uniform and are exclusively homosexual  He is disliked by the soldiers because they have to learn 21st century English to communicate with him and other senior staff  and because he is heterosexual  Engaging in combat thousands of light years away from Earth  Mandella and his soldiers need to resort to medieval weapons in order to fight inside a stasis field which neutralizes all electromagnetic radiation in anything not covered with a protective coating  They battle to survive what is to be the last conflict of the war  During the time that has since passed on Earth  humankind has begun to employ human cloning  resulting in a new  collective species calling itself Man  Man has developed a means of communication unique and inherent to clones  which allows them to communicate with the Taurans  leading to peace  When Man finally gains the ability to communicate with the Taurans  it is discovered that the Taurans were not responsible for the millennium old destruction of the colonial vessels in question  The futile  meaningless war that lasted for more than a thousand years ends  Man establishes several colonies of old style  heterosexual humans  just in case the evolutionary change proves to be a mistake  Mandella travels to one of these colonies  named 'Middle Finger' in the definitive novel adaption  There he is reunited with Marygay  who had been discharged much earlier and had intentionally used time dilation to age at a much slower rate  hoping and waiting for Mandella return  The epilogue is a news item from the year 3143 AD announcing the birth of a fine baby boy to Marygay Potter Mandella ,1,0,0,0,0
520,Robots and Empire,The Earthman Elijah Baley (the detective hero of the previous Robot books)  has died nearly two centuries earlier  During these two centuries  the balance of forces in the galaxy has changed dramatically  Inspired partly by Baley adventures in space (on the Spacer worlds of Solaria and Aurora)  Earth people have overcome their stagnation and agoraphobia  and embarked on a new wave of space colonization  using faster than light drive to reach distant planets throughout the Milky Way Galaxy  beyond the earlier Spacer worlds  These newly colonized worlds are clearly distinct from the earlier Spacer ones  and their inhabitants  calling themselves Settlers rather than Spacers  revere Earth as their mother world  Meanwhile  Baley memory remains in the mind of his former lover  Gladia Delmarre  a Spacer  who has a centuries long lifespan  as opposed to the seven or eight decades that Earth people (such as Baley) live  It is discovered that Solaria  the homeworld of Gladia  and the 50th established of the Spacer planets  has been abandoned and has become empty of all inhabitants (except for millions of robot servants  which have been left behind)  Gladia then meets a seventh generation descendant of Baley  Daneel Giskard (or D G ) Baley  a Settler Trader  He asks for Gladia help in visiting Solaria  in order to unravel the mysterious destruction of several Settler spaceships making landings there  and also with the mission of reclaiming the abandoned robots  Gladia agrees to go  and is accompanied by the positronic robots R  Daneel Olivaw and R  Giskard Reventlov  [R  Giskard has secret telepathic powers about which only R  Daneel knows ] These robots are both the former property of their creator  Dr  Han Fastolfe  who bequeathed them to Gladia in his will  At the same time  Daneel and Giskard are engaged in a struggle of wits with Fastolfe bitter archrivals  the roboticists Kelden Amadiro and Vasilia Aliena  Fastolfe estranged daughter  Whereas Fastolfe supported the expansion of the Settler population from Earth  Amadiro detests all Settlers   as do most Spacers  who consider all Earthlings to be little better than barbarians  Amadiro wants to see the Earthlings destroyed  so that the descendants of the Spacers alone can inherit the Milky Way (There are no other intelligent beings in Asimov fictional galaxy)  However  for many decades Amadiro has been continually thwarted in introducing an anti Settler policy into the governments of the Spacers  These blockings of Amadiro plans have been largely caused by the telepathic manipulation of key people by R  Giskard  Frustrated by his series of failures  Amadiro decides to accept an ambitious and unscrupulous apprentice  Levular Mandamus  Mandamus develops a cruel plan to destroy the population of the Earth  using a newly developed weapon  the nuclear intensifier  Amadiro and Mandamus intend to kill the population of the Earth and to make the Earth uninhabitable for human beings by using radioactivity  They intend to use the nuclear intensifier device to speed up all of the natural radioactive decay processes in the upper crust of the Earth  thereby making the surface of the Earth massively radioactive  [Note: At the time of Asimov writing  there had been the recent discovery of the W particle  which is the force carrier of the weak nuclear force  This force is responsible for most forms of nuclear decay: alpha emission and beta emission  The hypothetical nuclear intensifier would work by emitting large numbers of W particles  hence expediting nuclear decay ] While Amadiro schemes  R  Daneel and R  Giskard slowly assemble the pieces of the roboticists' genocidal plan for mass murder  The robots  sharing Fastolfe humane vision of a unified Settler/Spacer Galaxy   or  failing that  a Galaxy where Settlers can thrive in spite of Spacer domination   attempt to stop Amadiro  However  Daneel and Giskard are hampered by the Three Laws of Robotics  in particular  by the First Law of Robotics  which prevents them from making any direct attack on Amadiro  Daneel  meanwhile  has formulated an additional Zeroth Law of Robotics  which he thinks might help them to override the First Law  and to save the population of the Earth  The robots must work their way through the ramifications of the First Law and the Zeroth Law  in a race against time  before they face a confrontation with Amadiro and Mandamus  Fastolfe brilliant daughter Vasilia has long coveted the valuable Giskard  and she finally determines to take him away from Gladia  Then  when Vasilia deduces that Giskard has telepathy  she confronts him with this fact  Giskard is compelled to manipulate her mind telepathically in order to make her forget about his telepathic powers  This leaves the two positronic robots free to deal with Amadiro  The two robots locate Amadiro and Mandamus on Earth  where they find the two Spacers debating the best way to use the nuclear intensifier for their ghoulish purposes  (They just happen to be at the site of Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania)  After Amadiro admits to the robots their plans to carry out mass murder on the Earth  Giskard decides that it is necessary to tamper with Amadiro brain (using the newly created Zeroth Law)  Unfortunately  the way that Giskard does this causes irreversible damage to Amadiro brain   and thus harm to him  as is forbidden by the First Law  Giskard is mentally skating on thin ice in this regard   and he is not far from suffering the consequences of such action  Now standing alone with the robots  Mandamus claims that his intentions regarding the nuclear intensifier were more benign than Amadiro  Mandamus wants to draw out the radioactive catastrophe over many decades  rather than the mere years that Amadiro wanted  so that Amadiro could draw evil pleasure from the destruction of the Earth population within his own lifetime  Giskard decides that it would be best for humanity to abandon the Earth  hence he allows Mandamus to adjust the settings of the nuclear intensifier  He extends the time scale of the radioactive catastrophe to 150 years  allowing humanity to evacuate the Earth (though a significant population still dwells there at the time of the novel Pebble in the Sky)  Next  Giskard tampers with Mandamus mind as well  ensuring that Mandamus will have no memory of what has happened  Giskard predicts  correctly  that by forcing humanity hand into leaving the Earth  vigor will be reintroduced into mankind and the new Settlers will spread out across space at a rate never before seen  This will continue until all the governments of the interstellar colonies decide to unite into one Galactic Empire  However  by allowing Mandamus to proceed with his original plan  Giskard becomes instrumental in creating a very radioactive planet Earth  and hence placing the inhabitants of Earth under grave threat of death  This contradicts the First Law of Robotics  The Zeroth Law does not prove to be enough  to Giskard at least  to justify harming humans for the sake of a hypothetical future benefit  Under the stress of changing the course of humanity  R  Giskard himself suffers a cascading and soon fatal malfunction of his positronic brain  This is because he is not sure whether his actions will bring about an ultimate victory for the Spacers  leading to the final death of humanity  However before R  Giskard brain freezes  he confers his telepathic ability upon R  Daneel  and Daneel takes on the heavy burden of guiding the entire burgeoning Galactic civilization ,1,0,0,0,0
521,Foundation,Foundation tells the story of a group of scientists who seek to preserve knowledge as the civilizations around them begin to regress  (0 F E ) (First published as the book edition in 1951) Set in the year 0 F E   The Psychohistorians opens on Trantor  the capital of the 12 000 year old Galactic Empire  Though the empire appears stable and powerful  it is slowly decaying in ways that parallel the decline of the Western Roman Empire  Hari Seldon  a mathematician and psychologist  has developed psychohistory  a new field of science and psychology that equates all possibilities in large societies to mathematics  allowing for the prediction of future events  Using psychohistory  Seldon has discovered the declining nature of the Empire  angering the aristocratic members of the Committee of Public Safety  the de facto rulers of the Empire  The Committee considers Seldon views and statements treasonous  and he is arrested along with young mathematician Gaal Dornick  who has arrived on Trantor to meet Seldon  Seldon is tried by the Committee and defends his beliefs  explaining his theories and predictions  including his belief that the Empire will collapse in 500 years and enter a 30 000 year dark age  to the Committee members  He informs the Committee that an alternative to this future is attainable  and explains to them that creating a compendium of all human knowledge  the Encyclopedia Galactica  would not avert the inevitable fall of the Empire but would reduce the dark age to one millennium  The skeptical Committee  not wanting to make Seldon a martyr  offers him exile to a remote world  Terminus  with others who could help him create the Encyclopedia  He accepts their offer  prepares for the departure of the Encyclopedists and receives an imperial decree officially acknowledging his actions  (50 F E ) (published May 1942 as Foundation) Set in 50 F E   The Encyclopedists begins on Terminus  which has no mineral resources but one region suitable for the development of large city  named Terminus City  The colony of professionals  devoted to the creation of the Encyclopedia  is managed by the Board of Trustees of the Encyclopedia Galactica Foundation  composed solely of scientists  The affairs of Terminus City itself are handled by the city mayor  Salvor Hardin  who is virtually powerless due to the influence of the Board of Trustees  However  Hardin does not accept the status quo  which he believes puts Terminus in danger of political exploitation by the neighboring prefects of the Empire  which have declared independence and severed contact with Trantor  Hardin  recognizing the imminent downfall of imperial power due to the loss of the Empire outermost region  decides that the only way to ensure Terminus continued survival is to pit the four neighboring kingdoms against one another  Hardin manages to avoid an attempt by the Kingdom of Anacreon to establish military bases on Terminus and to take advantage of nuclear power  which Terminus retains but which the Four Kingdoms do not  Hardin succeeds in diverting Anacreon from its initial goal and furthers his goal of the establishment of a stable political system on Terminus  Hardin efforts  however  are still resisted by the Board of Trustees and its chairman  Dr  Louis Pirenne  To remove this obstacle  Hardin and his chief advisor  Yohan Lee  plan a coup d'etat designed to remove the Board of Trustees from its politically powerful position on the same day that  in the city Time Vault  a holographic recording of Hari Seldon is programmed to play  The recording will contain psychohistoric proof of Hardin success or failure; Hardin realizes that his coup is a great gamble due to the possible case that his beliefs are incompatible with Seldon original goals  At the playing of the Seldon recording  it is revealed that the Encyclopedia Galactica is a distraction intended to make the colony creation possible  The true goal of the Foundation is to further science in a galaxy consumed by interplanetary strife  the Board realizes  and hands its political power to the Terminus City mayoralty  Meanwhile  Lee engineers the nonviolent takeover of Foundation institutions by the city government  (80 F E ) (published June 1942 as Bridle and Saddle) Set in 80 F E   three decades after the events of The Encyclopedists  The Mayors is set in a time where the Encyclopedia Foundation scientific understanding has given it significant leverage over the Four Kingdoms  though it is still isolated from the Galactic Empire  Exercising its control over the region through an artificial religion  Scientism  the Foundation shares its technology with the Four Kingdoms while referring to it as religious truth  Maintenance technicians comprise Scientism priesthood  trained on Terminus  A majority of the priests themselves are unaware of the true importance of their religion  referring to advanced technology as holy food  The religion is not suppressed by the secular elite of the Four Kingdoms  reminscient of Western European rulers of the early medieval period  who use it to consolidate their power over the zealous populaces  Salvor Hardin  as Mayor of Terminus City  is the effective ruler of the Foundation  and has been reelected as mayor continuously since his political victory over the Encyclopedia Galactica Board of Trustees  However  his influence is suddenly checked by a new political movement led by city councillor Sef Sermak  which encourages direct action against the Four Kingdoms and a cessation of the scientific proselytizing encouraged by Hardin administration  The movement  whose followers refer to themselves as Actionists  is wildly popular  and Hardin is unable to appease Sermak and the Actionist leadership  The kingdom that is most concerning to the Actionists is that of Anacreon  ruled by Prince Regent Wienis and his nephew  the teenaged King Lepold I  Wienis plans to overthrow the Foundation power by launching a direct military assault against Terminus  making use of an abandoned Imperial space cruiser redesigned by Foundation experts to fit the needs of the elite Anacreonian navy  However  Hardin orders several secret technological devices to be incorporated into the ship design prior to its completion  Wienis plans to launch his offensive on the night of his nephew coronation as king and sole ruler of Anacreon  Hardin attends the coronation ceremony and is arrested  but has arranged with Anacreonian High Priest Poly Verisof  who is aware of the true nature of Scientism  to foster a popular uprising against Wienis  Convincing the Anacreonian populace that an assault against the Foundation and Terminus is blasphemous  Verisof leads an infuriated mob to the royal palace and surrounds it  demanding Hardin release  Meanwhile  the crew of the space cruiser mutinies against its commander  Admiral Prince Lefkin  Wienis son  Lefkin confronts the mutineers and  captured  is forced to broadcast a message to Anacreon demanding Wienis arrest and threatening a bombardment of the royal palace if that and other demands are not met  Wienis  maddened by his failure  orders Hardin execution  but his royal guardsmen refuse to obey him  Attempting and failing  due to a protective energy field  to kill Hardin personally  Wienis commits suicide  Hardin is proven correct again upon his return to Terminus City by another Seldon recording  set to play at this date  Though Actionists continue to hold a significant amount of power  an attempt to impeach the mayor fails and his popularity is renewed among the city residents  It is also confirmed by Hari Seldon that the Foundation immediate neighbors  the Four Kingdoms  will now be virtually powerless and incapable of resisting Scientism advance  (About 135 F E ) (published October 1944 as The Wedge) The events of The Traders are set around 135 F E   at a time during which the Foundation has expanded greatly and has sent out officially sanctioned Traders to exchange technology with neighboring planets for what amounts to greater political and economic power  Master Trader Eskel Gorov  also an agent of the Foundation government  has traveled to the worlds of Askone  where he hopes to trade nucleics  Gorov  however  is met with resistance by Askone governing Elders due to traditional taboos that effectively ban advanced technology  Gorov is imprisoned and sentenced to death; the Elders refuse Foundation requests for clemency  Trader Linmar Ponyets is ordered by the Foundation to try and negotiate with the Elders  and travels to the central Askonian planet  Ponyets meets with the Elders' Grand Master and deduces that  though he is determined to have Gorov executed  he may be willing to exchange the captive for a suitable bribe  which Ponyets realizes would be a sum of gold  Ponyets clumsily fashions a transmuter that will convert iron into gold  The Grand Master informs Ponyets that others who have attempted this have failed and have been punished with execution for both their attempt and for their failure; Ponyets succeeds and convinces the Grand Master that the gold is appropriate for Askonian religious decoration  which pleases the Elders  Councilor Pherl  the Grand Master prot√©g√©  appears to be wary of Ponyets  Meeting with the Councilor  Ponyets discovers that Pherl is instead quite willing to work with him  if only due to the chances of eventually attaining the Grand Mastership himself  Pherl  from a different ethnic background than traditional Grand Masters and a young man  believes that a stable supply of gold will be able to dramatically increase his power  and Ponyets provides him with the transmuter  It appears that the friendly Pherl will ascend to the Grand Mastership  while Gorov is released quickly  Ponyets discusses his success with Gorov  who criticizes his techniques due to what he perceives as Ponyets lack of morality  Ponyets replies by reminding Gorov of an alleged statement made by Salvor Hardin: Never let your sense of morals prevent you from doing what is right!

524,The Sparrow,The novel begins in the year 2019  when the SETI program  at the Arecibo Observatory  picks up radio broadcasts of music from the vicinity of Alpha Centauri  The first expedition to Rakhat  the world that is sending the music  is organized by the Jesuit order  Only one of the crew  Father Emilio Sandoz  a priest  survives to return to Earth  and he is damaged physically and psychologically  The story is told in framed flashback  with chapters alternating between the story of the expedition and the story of Sandoz' interrogation by the Jesuit order inquest  set up in 2059 to find the truth  Sandoz' return has sparked great controversy ‚Äì not just because the Jesuits sent the mission independent of United Nations oversight  but also because the mission ended disastrously  Contact with the UN mission  which sent Sandoz back to Earth alone in the Jesuit ship  has since been lost  From the beginning  Sandoz  a talented Taino linguist born in a Puerto Rican slum  had believed the mission to Rakhat was divinely inspired  Several of his close friends and co workers  people with a variety of unique skills and talents  had seemingly coincidental connections to Arecibo and one of them  a gifted young technician  was the first to hear the transmissions  In Sandoz mind  only God will could bring this group of people with the perfect combination of knowledge and experience together at the moment when the alien signal was detected  These were the people who  with three other Jesuit priests  were chosen by the Society of Jesus to travel to the planet  using an interstellar vessel made out of a small asteroid  Sandoz tells about how the asteroid flew to the planet Rakhat  and how the crew tried to acclimatize themselves to the new world  experimenting with eating local flora and fauna  then making contact with a rural village ‚Äì a small scale tribe of vegetarian gatherers  the Runa  clearly not the singers of the radio broadcasts  Still  welcomed as 'foreigners'  they settle among the natives and begin to learn their language and culture  transmitting all their findings via computer uplink to the asteroid ship now orbiting above the planet  An emergency use of fuel for their landing craft leaves them stranded on the planet  When they do meet a member of the culture which produced the radio transmissions  he proves to be of a different species from the rural natives  a Jana'ata  An ambitious merchant named Supaari  he sees in the visitors a possibility to improve his status  while the crew hopes to find an alternative source of fuel in Supaari city  Gayjur  Meanwhile  the crew begins to grow their own food  introducing the concept of agriculture to the villagers  These seemingly innocent actions and accompanying cultural misunderstandings set into motion the events which lead to the murder of all but Sandoz and one other Earthling  and Sandoz' capture and degradation which is a central mystery in the plot  It is revealed that Sandoz is made a slave of a famed poet/songwriter  whose broadcasts first alerted Earth to Rakhat existence  Sandoz is physically disfigured  In that culture  it is considered an honour to be dependent upon another  and likewise to have a dependent  so the flesh between Sandoz metacarpals is cut away to make it seem that he has long elegant fingers which start at his wrists  and with which he cannot even feed himself  Sandoz is routinely forced to sexually satisfy the musician  along with his friends and colleagues  and it is later revealed the songs which Sandoz had originally considered to be a divine revelation are in fact a kind of ballad pornography  relating the songwriter sexual exploits on broadcast to the populace  When Sandoz returns to Earth  his friends are dead and gone and his faith  once considered worthy of actual canonization by his superiors  is merely an extension of his bitter anger with the God who sent him to Rakhat  Due to relativistic space time effects  decades had passed while he has been gone  during which popular outrage at the UN initial and highly out of context report on the mission  and especially Sandoz role in the tragedy  had left the Society shattered and nearly extinct  As Sandoz painfully explains what really happened  his personal healing can begin  but only time will prove whether the same is true of the Society ,1,0,0,0,0

the gravity is significantly less; and the plants and mountains are strangely tall and thin  Ransom later meets a civilized native of Malacandra  a hross named Hyoi  a tall and well formed creature  He becomes a guest for several months in Hyoi village  where he uses his philological skills to learn the language of the hrossa and learns their culture  In the process he discovers that gold  known to the hrossa as sun blood  is plentiful on Malacandra  and thus is able to discern Devine motivation for making the voyage thither  Weston motives are shown to be more complex; he is bent on expanding humanity through the universe  abandoning each planet and star system as it becomes uninhabitable  The hrossa honour Ransom greatly by asking him to join them in a hunt for a hnakra (plural hn√©raki)  a fierce water creature which seems to be the only dangerous predator on the planet  resembling both a shark and a crocodile  While hunting  Ransom is told by an eldil  an almost invisible creature reminiscent of a spirit or deva  that he must meet Oyarsa  the eldil who is ruler of the planet  He hesitates to respond to the summons  as he wishes to proceed with the hunt  Hyoi  after killing the hnakra with Ransom help  is shot dead by Devine and Weston  who are seeking Ransom in order to take him prisoner and hand him over to the s√©roni  Ransom is told by Hyoi friend (another hross named Whin) that this is the consequence of disobeying Oyarsa  and that Ransom must now cross the mountains to escape Weston and Devine and fulfil his orders  On his journey  Ransom finally meets a sorn  as he long feared he might  He finds  however  that the s√©roni are peaceful and kindly  Augray (the sorn) explains to him the nature of Oyarsa body  and that of all eldila  The next day  carrying the human on his shoulders  Augray takes Ransom to Oyarsa  After a stop at the dwelling place of an esteemed sorn scientist  wherein Ransom is questioned thoroughly regarding all manner of facts about Earth  Ransom finally makes it to Meldilorn  the home of Oyarsa  In Meldilorn  Ransom meets a pfifltrigg who tells him of the beautiful houses and artwork his race make in their native forests  Ransom then is led to Oyarsa and a long awaited conversation begins  In the course of this conversation it is explained that there are Oy√©resu (the plural) for each of the planets in our solar system; in the four inner planets  which have organic life (intelligent and non intelligent)  the local Oyarsa is responsible for that life  The ruler of Earth (Thulcandra  the silent planet)  has turned evil (become bent) and has been restricted to Thulcandra  after great war  by the Oy√©resu and the authority of Maleldil  the ruler of the universe  Ransom is ashamed at how little he can tell Oyarsa about Earth and how foolish he and other humans seem to Oyarsa  While the two are talking  Devine and Weston are brought in guarded by hrossa  because they have killed three of that race  Oyarsa then directs a pfifltrigg to scatter the movements that were the bodies of Hyoi and the two other hrossa  using a small  crystalline instrument; once touched with this instrument  the bodies vanish  Weston is summoned to Oyarsa presence and makes a long speech justifying his proposed invasion of Malacandra on progressive and evolutionary grounds  which Ransom attempts to translate into Malacandrian  thus laying bare the brutality and crudity of Weston ambitions  Oyarsa listens carefully to Weston speech and acknowledges that the scientist is acting out of a sense of duty to his species  and not mere greed  This renders him more mercifully disposed towards the scientist  who accepts that he may die while giving Man the means to continue  However  on closer examination Oyarsa points out that Weston loyalty is not to Man mind   or he would value equally the alien minds already inhabiting Malacandra  instead of seeking to displace them in favour of humanity   nor to Man body   since  as Weston is well aware of and at ease with  Man physical form will alter over time  and indeed would have to in order to adapt to Weston programme of space exploration and colonisation  It seems then that Weston is loyal only to the seed   Man DNA   which he seeks to propagate  Here Weston eloquence fails him and he can only articulate that if Oyarsa does not understand Man basic loyalty to Man then he  Weston  cannot possibly instruct him  Oyarsa  passing judgment  tells Weston and Devine that he would not tolerate the presence of such creatures  but lets them leave the planet immediately  albeit under very unfavourable orbital conditions  To Ransom  Oyarsa offers him the option of staying on Malacandra  He decides he does not belong there  perhaps because he feels himself unworthy and perhaps because he yearns to be back among the human beings of earth  Oyarsa gives the men ninety days of air and other supplies  telling the Thulcandrians that after ninety days  the ship will disintegrate; either way  they will never return to Malacandra  Weston and Devine do not further harm Ransom  focussing their attention on the perilous journey home  Oyarsa had promised Ransom that the eldila of deep heaven would watch over and protect him against any attacks from the other two Thulcandrians  who might seek to kill him as a way of economizing their air and food supplies; at times  Ransom is conscious of benevolent presences within the spaceship‚Äîthe eldila  After a difficult return journey  the space ship makes it back to Earth  and is shortly unbodied according to Oyarsa will  Ransom himself half doubts whether all that happened was true  and he realizes that others will be even less inclined to believe it if he should speak of it  However  when the author (Lewis) writes him asking whether he has heard of the medieval Latin word Oyarses and knows what it meant  he lets him in on the secret  Ransom then dedicates himself to the mission that Oyarsa gave him before he left Malacandra of stopping Weston from further evil  The storyline may have been influenced by H  G  Wells First Men in the Moon  which Lewis described as The best of the sort Science Fiction I have read     in a letter to Roger Lancelyn Green  Wells book  like Lewis  reaches its climax with a meeting between an Earthman and the wise ruler of an alien world  during which the Earthman makes very ill considered boasts of his species' military prowess  The characters of Weston and Devine might be  in general  dark versions of Wells Cavor and Bradford  In both books  a scientist with a wide ranging mind forms a partnership with an eminently practical man who has a special attraction to extraterrestrial bars of gold  and they quietly build themselves a spaceship in the English countryside  In both stories  the interplanetary craft are spherical  though only Lewis' is called a space ship  According to the Oxford English Dictionary  J  J  Astor in his A Journey in Other Worlds first used the term space ship in 1894  but Lewis was the fourth person to use the term in published material ,1,0,0,0,0

he makes three wishes of Rincewind  Rincewind insists he cannot grant wishes with the snap of a finger  and discovers to his horror that snapping his fingers really does work  * To be Ruler of the World  Eric and Rincewind find themselves in the rain forests of Klatch  in the Tezumen empire  a parody of the Aztec empire  The local people come forward to pay tribute to Eric and declare him Ruler of the World  During this tribute  Rincewind and the parrot explore the temple of Quezovercoatl  where they find a prisoner  Ponce da Quirm (a parody of Juan Ponce de Le√≥n)  who is to be sacrificed  Da Quirm tells Rincewind about the terrible fate the Tezumen have planned for the Ruler of the World  on whom they blame all life misfortunes  Shortly  Rincewind  Eric and da Quirm find themselves tied up at the top of a pyramid  waiting to be sacrificed  when Quezovercoatl makes his appearance  Unfortunately for him  the luggage also makes an appearance  trampling the six inch tall Quezovercoatl in the process  The Tezumen are pleased to see Quezovercoatl destroyed  release the prisoners  and enshrine the luggage in the place of their god  At the end of the book  the Tezumen are revealed to have abandoned worshipping the Luggage as well (being as it never returned) and had turned atheist  which still allowed them to kill anyone they wanted  but they didn't have to get up so early to do it  * To Meet the Most Beautiful Woman in All History  Rincewind snaps his fingers again  and they find themselves in a large wooden horse (a parody of the Trojan Horse)  Exiting  they are surrounded by soldiers  who take them for an Ephebian invasion force  Rincewind manages to talk their way out of the Ephebian guards and out of the city  only to fall into the hands of the invading army  Rincewind and Eric are taken to Lavaeolus  the man who built the horse‚Äîhaving sent the horse in as a decoy so that he and his men could sneak in around the back while their enemies waited around the horse for them to come out‚Äîwho tells them off for spoiling the war  They reenter Tsort through a secret passage  and find Elenor (a parody of Helen of Troy)  Both Eric and Lavaeolus are disappointed to find that it has been a long siege  and Elenor is now a plump mother of several children  with the beginnings of a moustache  and that serious artistic licence had been taken in her description  The Ephebians escape the city while Tsort burns  and Lavaeolus and his army set out for home  with Lavaeolus complaining about voyages by sea (further reference to the Iliad and subsequent Odyssey)  Eric notes that Lavaeolus in Ephebian translates to Rinser of Winds  hinting that perhaps Lavaeolus is a relative of Rincewind  * To Live Forever  Rincewind snaps his fingers  bringing Eric and him outside of time  just before the beginning of existence  Rincewind meets the Creator  who is just forming the Discworld and is having trouble finishing some of the animals  Rincewind and Eric are left on the newly formed world  with the realization that to live forever means to live for all time  from start to finish  To escape  Rincewind has Eric reverse his summoning  taking them both to hell  They discover hell steeped in bureaucracy  where the Demon King Astfgl had decided boredom might be the ultimate form of torture  Rincewind uses his university experience to confuse the demons at their own game  so he and Eric can try to escape  While crossing through the recently reformed levels of hell (satirical forms of Dante Inferno) they encounter da Quirm and the parrot  as well as Lavaeolus  who tells them where the exit is  The source of Rincewind demonic powers is revealed to be Lord Vassenego  a Demon Lord leading a secret revolt against Astfgl  Using Rincewind to keep Astfgl occupied while gathering support amongst the demons  Vassenego confronts his king just as Astfgl finally catches up to Rincewind and Eric  Vassenego announces the council of demons has made Astfgl Supreme Life President of Hell  and that he is to plan out the course of action for demons  With Astfgl lost to the bureaucratic prison of his own making  Vassenego takes over as king and releases Rincewind and Eric  so that stories about hell can be told ,1,0,0,0,0
543,The Sirens of Titan,The protagonist is Malachi Constant  the richest man in 22nd century America  He possesses extraordinary luck that he attributes to divine favor which he has used to build upon his father fortune  He becomes the centerpoint of a journey that takes him from Earth to Mars in preparation for an interplanetary war  to Mercury with another Martian survivor of that war  back to Earth to be pilloried as a sign of Man displeasure with his arrogance  and finally to Titan where he again meets the man ostensibly responsible for the turn of events that have befallen him  Winston Niles Rumfoord  Rumfoord comes from a wealthy New England background  His private fortune was large enough to fund the construction of a personal spacecraft  and he became a space explorer  Traveling between Earth and Mars  his ship&mdash;carrying Rumfoord and his dog  Kazak&mdash;entered a phenomenon known as a chrono synclastic infundibulum  which is defined in the novel as those places     where all the different kinds of truths fit together  Vonnegut notes that any detailed description of this phenomenon would baffle the layman  but any comprehensible explanation would insult an expert  Consequently  he quotes an article from a (fictional) children encyclopedia  (Interestingly  much of Vonnegut information on the solar system came from a similar source ) According to this article  since the Universe is so large  there are many possible ways to observe it  all of which are equally valid  because people from across the Universe can not communicate with each other (and therefore can not get into an argument)  The chrono synclastic infundibula are places where these ways to be right coexist  When they enter the infundibulum  Rumfoord and Kazak become wave phenomena  somewhat akin to the probability waves encountered in quantum mechanics  They exist along a spiral stretching from the Sun to the star Betelgeuse  When a planet  such as the Earth  intersects their spiral  Rumfoord and Kazak materialize  temporarily  on that planet  When he entered the infundibulum  Rumfoord became aware of the past and future  Throughout the novel  he predicts future events; unless he is deliberately lying  the predictions always come true  It is in this state that Rumfoord established the Church of God the Utterly Indifferent on Earth to unite the planet after a Martian invasion  It is also in this state that Rumfoord  materializing on different planets  instigated the Martian invasion  On Titan  the only place where he can exist permanently as a solid human being  Rumfoord befriends a traveller from Tralfamadore (a world that also figures in Vonnegut Slaughterhouse Five  among several others) who needs a small metal component to repair his damaged spaceship  Salo  the Tralfamadorian explorer  is a robot built millennia earlier to carry a message to a distant galaxy  His spacecraft is powered by the Universal Will to Become  or UWTB  the prime mover which makes matter and organization wish to appear out of nothingness  (UWTB  Vonnegut informs the reader  was responsible for the Universe in the first place  and is the greatest imaginable power source  A small component on Salo spacecraft breaks and strands him here in the Sol System for over 200 millennia  He requests help from Tralfamadore  and his fellow Tralfamadorians respond by manipulating human history so that primitive humans evolve and create a civilization in order to produce the replacement part  Rumfoord encounter with the chrono synclastic infundibulum  the following war with Mars  and Constant exile to Titan were all manipulated via the Tralfamadorians' control of the UWTB  Stonehenge  the Great Wall of China and the Kremlin are all messages in the Tralfamadorian geometrical language  informing Salo of their progress  As it turns out  the replacement part is a small metal strip  brought to Salo by Constant and his son Chrono (born of Rumfoord ex wife)  A sunspot disrupts Rumfoord spiral  sending him and Kazak separately into the vastness of space  An argument between Rumfoord and Salo moments before  left unresolved because of Rumfoord disappearance  leads the distraught Salo to disassemble himself  thereby stranding the humans on Titan  Chrono chooses to live among the Titanian birds; after thirty two years  his mother dies  and Constant manages to reassemble Salo  Then  using the part delivered so many years previously by Chrono  he repairs the Tralfamdorian saucer  Salo returns Malachi to Earth  where Constant dies  experiences a pleasant hallucination secretly implanted in his mind by Salo  The book title is derived from a group of statues of three beautiful women which Salo sculpts out of Titanic peat ,1,0,0,0,0

545,How Few Remain,The point of divergence is September 10  1862  during the American Civil War  In our timeline  a Confederate messenger lost General Robert E  Lee Special Order 191  which detailed Lee plans for the Invasion of the North  The orders were soon found by Union soldiers  and using them  George McClellan was able to halt the Army of Northern Virginia at the Battle of Antietam  after which it returned to Virginia  In How Few Remain  the orders are instead recovered by a trailing Confederate soldier  McClellan is caught by surprise  enabling Lee to lead the Army of Northern Virginia towards Philadelphia  Lee forces McClellan into battle on the banks of the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania and destroys the Army of the Potomac in the Battle of Camp Hill on October 1  Lee goes on to capture Philadelphia  earning the Confederate States of America diplomatic recognition from both the United Kingdom and France  thus winning the war (which is known as the War of Secession in the alternate timeline) and independence from the United States on November 4  Kentucky  having been conquered by Confederate forces shortly after the Battle of Camp Hill  joins the eleven original Confederate states after the war conclusion  and the Confederacy is also given Indian Territory (our timeline state of Oklahoma  later the Southern Victory Series state of Sequoyah)  The Spanish island of Cuba is purchased by the Confederate States in the 1870s for $3 000 000  thus also becoming a Confederate territory  In 1881  Republican James G  Blaine has ridden a hard line platform of anti Confederatism into the White House  having defeated Democratic incumbent Samuel J  Tilden in the 1880 presidential election  Both American nations have been sanctioning Indian raids into each other territory  The international tension between the United States and the Confederate States peaks when Confederate President James Longstreet  desiring a Pacific coast for the confederacy so that the South can have a transcontinental railroad for itself  purchases the northwestern provinces of Sonora and Chihuahua from the financially strapped Mexican Empire (which is still ruled by France Maximilian) for CS $3 000 000  Blaine uses the coerced purchase as a casus belli  leading to the commencement of what will later become known as the Second Mexican War  After the Confederate purchase of the northern Mexican provinces of Sonora and Chihuahua  which extends the CSA USA border and gives the Confederates a Pacific port (Guaymas)  the United States declares war on the Confederacy  Early on in the war  Confederate troops under Jeb Stuart capture a large quantity of gold and silver ore from a Union mining town after successfully occupying the newly purchased provinces  Meanwhile  a Union cavalry colonel  George Armstrong Custer  successfully uses Gatling guns against Kiowa Indians and Confederate cavalry in Kansas  Soon  the United Kingdom and France  both Confederate allies  blockade and bombard US port cities  including those on the Great Lakes  During the war  the Mormons in Utah rebel by severing transcontinental communication and transportation around Salt Lake City  John Pope is appointed as the military governor  puts down the revolt  and imposes martial law  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints is classified as a political organization and the Mormon leaders are hunted down and executed  The United States' attempt to invade Virginia is easily thrown back by General Stonewall Jackson as the United States struggles to find a man his equal  A key reason for the Confederate success in the war  in addition to fighting a defensive war  is that the Confederates are led by excellent generals like Jackson  while the United States military  despite possessing a massive advantage in numbers and resources  suffers from incompetent leadership  William Rosecrans  the commander of the entire US army  casually reveals at one point that there is no overall strategy for winning the war whatsoever  He envisions a vague idea of the opposing armies making counteroffensives back and forth against each other  which he feels the United States would assuredly win  This lack of planning leaves the German military observer  Alfred von Schlieffen  aghast  The United States next attempts to launch a massive invasion of Louisville to knock the Confederates out of Kentucky but it soon becomes a bloody stalemate  The decision of Stonewall Jackson to command the defense personally  the negligence of United States  commanders  and most of all  the use of breech loading artillery and repeating rifles make taking the city very difficult  The Confederate army never tries to invade any United States territory for two reasons  First  it does not have the resources for an offensive into hostile lands  Second  the Confederacy success hinges on the support of Britain and France  who feel they are aiding a smaller nation wrongfully attacked by a larger one  and launching attacks into the United States would be seen as aggression for which they might lose foreign support  Galled by orders to wage a purely defensive war  Jackson takes them to the extreme  pioneering tactics of full scale trench warfare which devastates Louisville (in scenes reminiscent of the World War I of mainline reality)  The Louisville campaign quickly bogs down for the United States  and results in a bloodbath with little territory gained  The United Kingdom and France continue to shell the Great Lakes ports; France also shells Los Angeles  while the British bombard San Francisco and raid the Federal mint  The United States receives some good news when a young volunteer cavalry colonel  Theodore Roosevelt  and George Armstrong Custer rout a British division under Charles Gordon invading Montana from Canada  However  the British also invade northern Maine and annex it into the Canadian province of New Brunswick  Finally  facing defeat on almost all fronts  Republican president James G  Blaine is forced to capitulate  A Republican is never again elected to the White House  The United States  learning the importance of strong allies  seeks an alliance with the newly formed and powerful German Empire  The alliance sets up events for the next three series  which cover an alternate World War I  Inter war period  and World War II ,1,0,0,0,0
546,Perelandra,The story starts with the philologist Elwin Ransom  some years after his return from Mars at the end of Out of the Silent Planet  receiving a new mission from Oyarsa  the angelic ruler of Mars  After summoning Lewis  the first person narrator  to his country home  Ransom explains to Lewis that he (Ransom) is to travel to Perelandra (Venus)  where is located a new Garden of Eden and a new Adam and Eve  to oppose the diabolically possessed human physicist Professor Weston  who has been sent to corrupt the Eve figure  He is transported in a boxlike vessel seemingly made of ice  which contains only himself  He gets Lewis to blindfold him so the sunlight will not blind him once he travels beyond the earth atmosphere  He does not wear any clothes on the journey as Oyarsa tells him clothes are unnecessary on Venus  He returns to Earth about a year later and is met by Lewis and another friend: the remainder of the story is told from Ransom point of view  with Lewis acting as interlocutor and occasional commentator  Ransom arrives in Venus after a journey in which he is surrounded by bright colours; the box dissolves leaving Ransom on what appears to be an oceanic paradise  One day is about 23 Earth hours  in contrast to the (roughly) 24 and 25 hour days of Earth and Mars  The sky is golden and very bright but opaque  Hence the sun cannot be seen  and the night is pitch black with no stars visible  Strange  mythical creatures resembling small dragons roam the planetary sweet water ocean  which is dotted with floating rafts of vegetation  These rafts resemble islands  to the extent of having plant and animal life upon them; however  having no geologic foundations  they are in a constant state of motion  The planet sole observable geological feature is a mountain called the Fixed Land  Ransom meets Tinidril  the Queen of the planet; a cheerful being who soon accepts him as a friend  Unlike the inhabitants of Mars in Out of the Silent Planet  she resembles a human in physical appearance with the exception of her skin color  green; this is said to be the preferred form assumed by sentient creatures as a result of the manifestation of Maleldil  the second person of God  in human form  She and the King of the planet  who is largely unseen until the end  are the only human inhabitants and are the Eve and Adam of their world  They live on the floating raft islands and are forbidden to sleep on the Fixed Land  The rafts or floating islands are indeed Paradise  not only in the sense that they provide a pleasant and care free life (until the arrival of Weston) but also in the sense that Ransom is for weeks and months naked in the presence of a beautiful naked woman without once lusting after her or being tempted to seduce her  The plot thickens when Professor Weston arrives in a spaceship and lands in a part of the ocean quite close to the Fixed Land  He at first announces that he is a reformed man  but appears to still be in search of power  He pledges allegiance to what he calls the Life Force  and subsequently shows signs of demonic possession  Weston finds the Queen and tries to tempt her into defying Maleldil orders by spending a night on the Fixed Land  Ransom  perceiving this  believes that he must act as a counter tempter  Well versed in the Bible and Christian theology  Ransom realises that if the pristine Queen  who has never heard of Evil  succumbs to Weston arguments  the Fall of Man will be re enacted on Perelandra  He struggles through day after day of lengthy arguments illustrating various approaches to temptation  but the demonic Weston shows super human brilliance in debate (though when off duty he displays moronic  asinine behaviour and small minded viciousness) and moreover appears never to need sleep  With the demonic Weston on the verge of winning  the desperate Ransom hears in the night what he gradually realises is a Divine voice  commanding him to physically attack the Tempter  Ransom is reluctant  and debates with the divine (inner) voice for the entire duration of the night  A curious twist is introduced here; whereas the name Ransom is said to be derived from the title Ranolf Son  it can also refer to a reward given in exchange for a treasured life  Recalling this  and recalling that his God would (and has) sacrificed Himself in a similar situation  Ransom decides to confront the Tempter outright  Ransom attacks his opponent bare handed  using only physical force  The Tempter  unable to withstand this despite his superior abilities of rhetoric  flees  whereupon Ransom chases him over the ocean  Weston fleeing and Ransom chasing on the backs of giant and friendly fish  During a fleeting truce  the 'real' Weston momentarily re inhabits his body  and recounts his experience of Hell  wherein the damned soul is not consigned to pain or fire  as supposed by popular eschatology  but is absorbed into the Devil  losing all independent existence  While Ransom is distracted by his horror and his feelings of pity and compassion for Weston  the demon takes control of the body  surprises Ransom  and tries to drown him  The chase continues into a subterranean cavern  where Ransom seemingly kills Weston and  believing his quest to be over  searches for a route to the surface  Weston body  horribly injured but still animated by the Devil  follows him  When they meet for the last time in another cavern  Ransom hurls at Weston head a stone and consigns the body to volcanic flames  Returning to the planet surface after a long travail through the caverns of Perelandra  Ransom recuperates from his injuries  all of which heal fully except for a bite on his heel which he sustained at some point in the battle; this bite continues bleeding for the rest of his time on Perelandra and is remains unhealed when he returns to earth  Ransom meets the King and Queen together with the Oy√©resu of Mars and Venus  the latter of whom transfers its divinely ordained dominion over the planet to the King and Queen  All the characters celebrate the prevention of a second biblical Fall and the beginning of a utopian paradise in this new world  The story climaxes with Ransom vision of the essential truth of life in the Solar System  and possibly of the nature of God: strongly paralleling the journeys of Dante in the Divine Comedy  His mission on Venus accomplished  he returns  rather reluctantly  to Earth in the same manner in which he made the outward journey; his new mission is to continue the fight against the forces of evil on their own territory ,1,0,0,0,0
547,Teranesia, The novel explores an unusual connection between molecular genetics and quantum computing  with criticism of some of what it considers the excesses of postmodernism and feminism  However  most of the novel focuses on future south east Asian politics (Egan criticizes Indonesian imperialism and Australian treatment of refugees)  repressed childhood guilt  evolutionary biology and academic life  As often in Egan books  there is some focus on sexuality: this time the lead character is gay  rather than one of the more exotic alternatives in other novels ,1,0,0,0,0
548,The Last Hero,A message  carried by pointless albatross  arrives for Lord Vetinari from the Agatean Empire  The message explains that the Silver Horde (a group of aged barbarians introduced in Interesting Times  wherein they conquered the Empire  and led by Cohen the Barbarian  now the Emperor) have set out on a quest  The first hero of the Discworld  Fingers Mazda  stole fire from the gods and gave it to mankind  and was chained to a rock to be torn open daily by a giant eagle as punishment  As the last heroes remaining on the Disc  the Silver Horde seek to return fire to the gods with interest  in the form of a large sled packed with explosive Agatean Thunder Clay  They plan to blow up the gods at their mountain home  Cori Celesti  With them is a whiny  terrified bard  whom they have kidnapped so that he can write the saga of their quest  Along the way  they are joined by Evil Harry Dread (the last Dark Lord) and Vena (an elderly heroine)  The heroes are disillusioned with the way their lives have turned out‚Äîhaving conquered the Empire  they have nothing left to do but die in comfort‚Äîand are angry for having been allowed to grow old  rather than dying in battle as most of their friends did  They decided to go out on the quest after one of the Horde members choked to death on a cucumber  Evil Harry is just as angry; despite his efforts to give his opponents the sporting chance that an Evil Overlord should  they will not follow the Code by allowing him to escape in return  The Wizards of Unseen University explain to Lord Vetinari that blowing up Cori Celesti will destroy the Discworld by temporarily disrupting the Disc magical field‚Äîthe only thing holding the Disc together‚Äîso Vetinari organises an effort to stop the Horde  Since the Horde is already near the centre of the Discworld and the home of the gods  speed is of the essence  Vetinari recruits Leonard of Quirm to design the Discworld second known spacecraft to slingshot under the Discworld and back around the top  landing on Cori Celesti  The vessel  named The Kite by Leonard  can carry only three people  Leonard of Quirm  Captain Carrot Ironfoundersson  and Rincewind are selected for the trip  The Librarian accidentally stumbles aboard as well  having fallen asleep behind some crates of equipment while loading The Kite  After a few mishaps  including landing on the moon (to replenish their oxygen supply after the Librarian unexpected presence threatened to leave them without enough air to survive the trip) and nearly having their swamp dragon powered spaceship explode on them  they crash in a spectacular fashion at  or rather  into the main gate of Cori Celesti  Meanwhile  the Horde have already reached Cori Celesti  The gods allow them to sneak in disguised as gods themselves  despite (or perhaps because of) their having been betrayed to the gods by Evil Harry  The Horde suspect that the gods have been manipulating their entire quest  Fate challenges Cohen to a game where he must roll higher than what Fate rolls on a standard 6 sided die  After Fate rolls a 6  Cohen cheats Fate by slicing the die in half in mid air with his sword; the two halves land with the 6 and 1 both facing up  Cohen also notes that even if he does not succeed in killing the gods  someone will have tried  so someone will eventually try harder  Captain Carrot attempts to arrest the Horde  at which point the Horde arms the explosives  While initially intending to attack him  the Horde realise that as a single brave man outnumbered by his foes and trying to save the world  Carrot is a Hero (and probably a king in disguise)  and so their defeat is certain  After Rincewind explains that detonating the explosives will destroy the entire Discworld  the Horde grab the already live explosives and throw the explosives‚Äîand themselves‚Äîoff the mountain  As punishment for creating The Kite (which allowed humans to travel higher than the gods) and for not expressing belief in the gods  Leonard is ordered by the gods to paint the entire ceiling of the Temple of Small Gods with a spectacular mural of the whole world (despite Blind Io saying he would be satisfied with a nice duck egg blue with a few stars)  They impose a time limit of 10 years on the task‚Äîunassisted  even with the scaffolding  (Leonard finishes the task in a few weeks ) Carrot asks for a boon to allow for the repairs of The Kite so that they can return to Ankh Morpork  Rincewind asks for a blue balloon and the Librarian asks for some library supplies (and manages to refrain from bouncing Blind Io head on the ground after Io calls him 'a monkey')  The Horde end is ambiguous  Valkyries come to take the heroes to the Halls of the Slain  where a feast has been prepared for them  Instead  the Silver Horde  refusing to accept their deaths  steal the valkyries' horses and set off to find other worlds to do heroic stuff in  Death does not appear to them  as he often does when Discworld characters die  although he subsequently appears to Vena  and is evasive about whether he is collecting  After the Horde leave with the Valkyries' horses  their first stop is to visit Mazda where he is being punished  cut off his chains  give him something to drink  and leave him a sword so that he may deal with his punisher  The bard  changed by his experience  composes a new style of saga  one with musical accompaniment  about it ,1,0,0,0,0

550,Roma Eterna,The novel is presented as a series of vignettes over a period of about 1500 years  from 1282 ab urbe condita (AD 529) to 2723 AUC (AD 1970)  Most of the story chapters involve Roman politics  either the competition between the Western and Eastern Empires to dominate the other or the violent creation of the Second Roman Republic in about 2603 AUC (AD 1850)  Others describe the first Roman circumnavigation of the world and unsuccessful attempts to conquer Nova Roma (North America)  Many features of our own history are repeated in this history  though under changed circumstances: The equivalent of the 16th and 17th Centuries have bold navigators and adventurers  romanticised by later generations but unpleasantly brutal and ruthless when looked at closely; in the late 18th to mid 19th Centuries  a decadent old order is overthrown by revolution followed by a reign of terror and the reemergence of Republicanism; though Italy remains a central part of the Roman Empire  the Latin dialect spoken there develops into a kind of Italian  and the name Marcus changes into Marco; though Vienna is a provincial capital which never had an Emperor of its own  its population dances the Waltz; by the 20th Century  people travel by cars rather than carriages and by the second half of the century  space flight is achieved  It concludes with the first story to be written  when a group of Hebrew citizens in Alexandria prepare to depart Earth in a rocket which explodes shortly after takeoff  But they will try again  still believing God chose them to inherit the Promised Land  just not on Rome dominated Earth ,1,0,0,0,0
551,The Emerald City of Oz, At the beginning of this story  it is made quite clear that Dorothy  the primary protagonist of many of the previous Oz books  is in the habit of freely speaking of her adventures to her only living relatives  her Aunt Em and Uncle Henry  Neither of them believes a word of her stories  but consider her a dreamer  She is undeterred  unlike her alter ego in the film Return to Oz  who is much perturbed by her guardians' doubts  Later  it is revealed that the destruction of their farmhouse by the cyclone in the original book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz has left Uncle Henry in terrible debt  In order to pay it  he has taken out a mortgage on his farm  If he cannot repay his creditors  they will seize the farm  He is not afraid for himself  but both he and his wife  Aunt Em  fear very much for their niece future  Dorothy arranges with Princess Ozma to take them to the Land of Oz  where they will be safe  Using the magic belt  a tool captured from the jealous Nome King Roquat  Ozma transports them to her throne room  They are given rooms to live in and luxuries to enjoy  including a vast and complex wardrobe  They meet with many of Dorothy animal friends  including the Cowardly Lion and Billina the Yellow Hen  In the underground Nome Kingdom  the desirous Roquat is plotting to seize the Land of Oz  He was greatly embarrassed years ago when Dorothy  Ozma  and their many friends entered his domain and freed the royal family of Ev from imprisonment; as a result  he wants to embarrass them in a similar way  After ordering the expulsion of his General  who will not agree to such an attack  and the death of his Colonel  who also refuses  King Roquat holds counsel with a veteran soldier called Guph  Guph believes that against the many magicians and magicks of Oz (the reputation of which has grown in the telling)  the Nome Army has no chance alone  He therefore sets out personally to recruit allies  Dorothy  accompanied by the Wizard of Oz and several other friends  departs the Emerald City in a carriage drawn by the Wooden Sawhorse  intending to give her aunt and uncle a tour of the land  Many of the people encountered have never been seen in other books: the living cut out paper dolls created by an immortal called Miss Cuttenclip; the anthropomorphic jigsaw puzzles known as the Fuddles; the loquacious Rigmaroles; the paranoid Flutterbudgets; the living kitchen utensils of Utensia; the anthropomorphic pastries of Bunbury; the civilized rabbits of Bunnybury; and the zebra  who holds geographical disputes with a crab  Other figures  more familiar to readers of previous books  include the Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow  as well as the four tribes of Oz‚Äîthe Munchkins  the Quadlings  the Gillikins  and the Winkies  The Nome General Guph visits three nations; the Whimsies  the Growleywogs  and the Phanfasms  The Whimsies are large and hulking  but possess disproportionately small heads  This causes other species to call them stupid  stripping them of any self esteem  To deny this  the Whimsies wear enormous  luridly designed masks that cover all of their heads  The Growleywogs are muscular giants  possessing no surplus flesh and no mercy  They are arrogant and cruel  As such  they are eager not only to help the Nomes conquer Oz  but also to subjugate the Nomes as well  Of the latter plan  they say nothing  but send Guph on his way  Last of his meetings is that which is with the mysterious  diabolical Phanfasms  To Guph  the Phanfasms resemble men  but having the heads of various carnivorous animals  Their true forms  number  standard of living  culture  and extent of influence remain unknown to both Guph and the reader  although both receive hints in the narrative  The Phanfasms send Guph home  telling him that they will conquer Oz alongside the other armies  It is their plan to do so  then to turn traitor and dominate their allies  Having learned of this through Ozma omniscient Magic Picture  the people of Oz become worried  The climax takes place in the Emerald City  where Ozma wishes (using her magic belt) for a large amount of dust to appear in the tunnel  The Nome King and his allies are defeated after they drink thirstily from the Fountain of Oblivion and forget all their evil plans  Ozma uses the magic belt to send them all home  To forestall a future invasion of Oz Glinda uses a magic charm to render Oz invisible and unreachable to everyone except those within the land itself ,0,1,0,0,0
552,A Door Into Ocean, The novel is set in the future  on the fictional planet of Shora  a moon covered by water  The inhabitants of this planet  known as Sharers  are all female  Sharers use genetic engineering to control the ecology of their planet  They are peaceful beings who share ‚Äî that is  they have a spiritual and linguistic union with each other and treat everyone equally  The Sharers take egalitarianism for granted because they share and they lack the concept of power over  making their society one in which conflicts are settled without violence  When they are being threatened by an outside power  they resist nonviolently because they refuse to believe in power  Thus  the Sharers can never be subdued by force  The Sharer way of nonviolence is more than spiritual  It is based on historical realities of nonviolent resistance  The author based the events of her novel on much historical research  particularly the writings of peace historian Gene Sharp  The novel includes much biological research into the evolution of innate capacities for nonviolence  For example  the participation of children in nonviolent resistance draws on deep instinctual responses found in humans and related mammals  A unique expression of the Sharer way is their language  in which subject and object are interchangeable  The Sharers know by context what subject and object are‚Äîbut their language does not allow them to make a distinction  As a result  they always know that what one person forces upon another can always go the other way  Their language impedes anyone from giving orders to dominate others  For example  if a stranger says  You must obey me  the Sharer hears  I must obey you  or (the closest translation)  We must share agreement  Their language reinforces the Sharers' inability to accept any situation in which one individual dominates another by force  The Sharer worldview extends to their environment  their surrounding ecosystem  They cannot act upon their plants and animals without being acted upon in return  So  for example  because Sharers consume plants and animals as food  they accept the fact that they in turn will become food for other life forms; that predators will ultimately consume them  At the beginning of the novel  the Sharers are all female  But as they encounter a non Sharer community from another planet  which threatens them  the Sharer Merwen realizes that they must find out whether other kinds of people can share their life or not  Merwen goes to the other planet  Valedon  to recruit a young man  Spinel  to return to Shora and attempt to learn their ways  This venture leads to disagreement within the Sharer community (they have plenty of disagreements  though addressed without violence)  With many false starts  Spinel gradually learns the Sharer way  as a man; and ultimately he works with the Sharers to help them defend their planet from a military invasion ,1,0,0,0,0
553,The Mote in God Eye,The book is split up into four parts  In the year AD 3017  humanity is recovering slowly from an interstellar civil war that tore apart the first Empire of Man  A new Empire has risen and is occupied in establishing control over the remnants of its predecessor  by force if needed  Commander Lord Roderick Blaine  having participated in the suppression of a rebellion on the planet of New Chicago  is given command of an Imperial battlecruiser  INSS MacArthur  when the captain has to stay behind to restore order on the planet  Blaine is given secret orders to take Horace Hussein Bury  a powerful interstellar merchant of Arabic descent who is suspected of fomenting the revolt for his own profit  to the Imperial capital  Sparta  Blaine is one of the few people available who is wealthier than Bury  so he is the ideal man for the mission as he can not be bribed  MacArthur is to be repaired in the New Caledonia system  then proceed to the capital  Another passenger is Lady Sandra Bright Sally Fowler  the niece of an Imperial Senator and a rescued prisoner of the rebels  New Caledonia is the capital of the Trans Coalsack sector  located on the opposite side of the Coalsack Nebula from Earth  Also in the sector is a red supergiant star known as Murcheson Eye  Associated with it is a yellow Sun like star  From New Caledonia  the yellow star appears in front of the Eye  Since some see the Eye and the Coalsack as the face of a hooded man  perhaps even the face of God  the yellow star is known as the Mote in God Eye  While in the New Caledonia system  Blaine receives a message saying that an alien spacecraft has been detected  and includes an order that MacArthur intercept it  Human ships use the Alderson Drive  which allows them to jump instantaneously between points in specific star systems  The alien craft  by contrast  is propelled by a solar sail  taking 150 years to cross between stars at sublight speed  MacArthur duly intercepts the craft and is fired upon by its automated systems  but manages to capture it relatively intact  However  on arrival at the planet New Scotland  its single occupant  evidently the pilot  is found to be dead  The alien is bizarrely asymmetric  with two delicate arms on one side of its body and a single  much larger and stronger arm on the other  Although it is bipedal and has a head and face similar to humans  its anatomy is entirely different  It has no flexible spine and the face is capable of little expression  It is the first apparently intelligent alien race that humans have come into contact with  The ship itself is composed of alloys with remarkable properties and designed around unique  custom built parts  no two alike  that perform multiple unrelated tasks simultaneously  MacArthur and the battleship Lenin are sent to the Mote: the star from which the alien ship came  MacArthur carries civilian research teams intended to meet with and investigate the Moties  while Lenin is there to ensure the security of humanity technology and secrets  avoiding all contact with the aliens  Aboard Lenin is the commander in charge of the mission  Admiral Lavrenti Kutuzov  a ruthless  supremely loyal officer who had already sterilized one rebellious colony planet to safeguard Imperial Reunification  Bury goes along ostensibly because a merchant is needed to assess the trade possibilities  but actually because there is nobody trustworthy enough to take him to the capital  Sally  a trained anthropologist  ranks too highly in the political aristocracy to be refused  Despite (or rather  due to) the civilians' distrust  Blaine remains in command of MacArthur  The Mote has only one Alderson point leading to it  and to reach it the ships must actually enter the outer layers of the red supergiant itself before activating the drive  Supergiant stars are up to 500 million km in diameter  but the outer layers are basically a hot vacuum  which the human ships can survive because of the protective Langston Field  MacArthur successfully makes contact with the Moties  They have advanced technology (in some areas superior to that of the First Empire  let alone the current Second)  but seem friendly and willing to share it  Indeed  they would have been a formidable threat to Humanity  had they not been bottled up in their home system  Although they also possess the Alderson Drive  they consider it a failure‚Äîthe Crazy Eddie Drive which makes ships disappear  When everything works perfectly  the termination of their Alderson Drive tramline inside the supergiant destroys their ships  since they have no knowledge of the protective Field  The Moties deduce that humans use the drive because MacArthur and Lenin appear at the Crazy Eddie Point  the local origin of their tramline  The Moties are an old species that has evolved into many specialized subspecies  The first to board MacArthur is an engineer  a brown fur form with amazing technical abilities but limited speech  who brings along a pair of tiny Motie Watchmakers as assistants  Some days later  an official delegation of Motie Mediators arrives  brown and white forms like the dead pilot of the probe ship  who have astounding communication and negotiation skills but very limited ability with tools  A contact party of humans  including Sally Fowler  accompanies them to the surface of Mote Prime  Each Mediator adopts a particular human in this group  becoming his (her in Sally case) Fyunch(click)  studying their subject and learning how to think like him or her  even to the point of exactly reproducing voice and mannerisms  Back on MacArthur  disaster strikes  The Watchmakers have escaped  and although it was assumed they had died  they have actually been breeding furiously  Despite several attempts to rid MacArthur of the infestation  the Watchmakers  unknown to the human crew  continued quietly redesigning MacArthur and rebuilding it for greater living space  When they are discovered  a losing battle for control of the ship erupts  The crew is eventually forced to abandon ship  The contact party is also recalled without explanation and told to rendezvous directly with Lenin  which destroys MacArthur to prevent the capture of human technology  These events reveal the existence of an improved Langston Field which expands as it absorbs energy  increasing its surface area and dissipating heat faster  During the evacuation  three MacArthur midshipmen escape from the ship in lifeboats  Unfortunately  these were reconstructed by the descendants of the escaped Watchmakers  and automatic controls force a landing in an unpopulated area of Mote Prime  Exploring unsupervised for the first time  they find a fortified dome like structure whose doors are locked by a puzzle that requires relatively advanced knowledge of astronomy to solve  It is a perfectly maintained yet completely deserted building that appears to be some type of museum  Every aspect of Motie civilization is preserved in detail  including in place fragments of several smaller domes which have been violently shattered  The exhibits as a whole provide evidence of a very long and violent history  though the Moties had carefully portrayed themselves to the Expedition members as completely peaceful  Following this discovery  the midshipmen  Jonathon Whitbread  Horst Staley  and Gavin Potter  are reunited with Whitbread Fyunch(click) Mediator escort  who reveals the self destructive character underlying Motie society  Unlike human wars motivated by greed or malice  the Motie civilization is driven to conflict because of biology  The Moties are sequential hermaphrodites  changing sex over and over again during the course of their lives  However  if a Motie remains female for too long without becoming pregnant  the hormone imbalance will kill her  This characteristic ensures a never ending population explosion  Attempts at population control through chemicals or infanticide have always failed for the Moties  because those who (secretly or openly) breed uncontrollably eventually swamp those Moties who comply  Once the population pressure rises high enough  massive wars inevitably result  Humans have encountered eight of the larger Motie subspecies  not including hybrids such as the Mediators: Masters  Engineers  Doctors  Porters  Farmers  Runners  Watchmakers and Meats  but the Masters concealed the existence of another type   the Warriors  Bred specifically for combat  they are innately superior in ability to any human soldier and capable of using any type of weapon  There are no longer any fissionable materials remaining in the Mote system  but asteroid bombardments serve as more than adequate weapons of mass destruction  giving the entire surface of the planet a cratered appearance resembling Mars  Each war typically ends in the complete destruction of the current civilization on Mote Prime  However  due to their high birth rates  enough Moties always survive to eventually repopulate the planet  A faster rise to civilization leads to a longer period between Collapses  since productivity increases more quickly than the population  The museums exist to accelerate this process after a collapse  They are located in unpopulated areas to avoid their destruction during the inevitable wars  Once the surviving population is advanced enough to solve the puzzle at the door  they have access to a literal catalogue of civilizations  and the weapons to put them into effect  Population is controlled by disease and injury between collapses and reconstructions  but the cycles have thus far never been stopped completely  The cycles of civilization  war  and collapse have apparently been repeating for hundreds of thousands of years  In some cases  Mote Prime was completely sterilized and then repopulated by those living in hollowed out asteroids within the system  The current asymmetrical form is probably a mutation resulting from nuclear weaponry prior to a collapse  Presumably  each civilization arises  unlocks the museums  and discovers that unless they can solve a problem that had plagued countless others  they are doomed  Thus  the Moties have become fatalistically resigned to the never ending Cycles  Only a mythical character called Crazy Eddie believes there is a way to change this  and any Motie who comes to believe a solution is possible is labeled as a Crazy Eddie and deemed insane  The current civilization is organized as a type of industrial feudalism  where coalitions of related Masters govern the planet  Using the system Alderson point to colonize other planets is proposed as one (ultimately unworkable) solution to the Cycles  leading to its designation as the Crazy Eddie Point  Conflict erupts on Mote Prime between two groups of Masters considering this idea  The smaller group recognizes that expansion to other planets would only postpone the Cycles; nearby planets would soon be filled with Moties  and the Alderson Drive takes time to use ‚Äî years of travel across systems from tramline to tramline to reach distant planets  Eventually  it would be easier for Moties to challenge humans for their planets  especially since humans cannot compete with Moties  technologically  biologically  or even numerically  Motie victory would be inevitable  but eventually futile as the population continues to expand exponentially  However  the more powerful coalition of Masters sees this temporary solution as more appealing than the impending phase of collapse  Both groups send envoys to the human worlds with instructions to negotiate for the majority position  To conceal the danger to human civilization  the three midshipmen who reached Mote Prime are not permitted to return to Lenin and are killed while resisting capture  Lenin returns home  taking with it ‚Äî in violation of explicit orders to avoid contact at all costs ‚Äî the three Motie ambassadors  Kutuzov takes this step only after much debate  The Motie embassy contains two Mediators called Charlie and Jock  and a Keeper (a sterile Master)  known as Ivan  The choice of three infertile Moties occurs both to avoid conflict on Mote Prime  since no single family will control the mission  and to continue the deception of the humans  Their mission is to open the galaxy to their ships while concealing the inevitable drive to war of any Motie civilization  The Jump out of Mote System with the Alderson Drive reveals that the more complex nervous systems of the Moties produce a much more intense version of jump shock than humans experience  Back on New Caledonia  an Imperial Commission is on the verge of granting colonies to the Moties  not realizing the ultimate danger  Fortunately  MacArthur‚Äôs sailing master  the unconventional Kevin Renner  manages to assemble various clues unknowingly gathered during the expedition  In particular  a series of images taken by MacArthurs cameras as it was attacked by the Motie probe ship reveal the well kept secret of the Motie Warrior caste  This information  combined with the knowledge of unlimited population growth on Mote Prime  forces the commission to decide against permitting the Moties to leave their home system  Because the Moties learned about the Langston Field  enabling them to establish colonies independently  it seems the only option is to send the Fleet to eradicate the entire Motie species  However  the Mediator Charlie  who represents the minority view from Mote Prime  persuades the Commission to establish a permanent blockade of the system only worthwhile exit through the Alderson point  allowing the Moties to survive with the seemingly endless Cycles  until such time as the humans can find a cure for their birth rate  something sane Moties think impossible  With Motie assistance in planning the blockade  the Commission accepts this alternative  Since the Moties are helpless for so long after a Jump  the ships of the human fleet can easily destroy any blockade runners with their laser weaponry  especially within the superheated photosphere of Murcheson Eye  Even the Moties' improvement on the Langston Field ‚Äî causing it to expand as it absorbs energy so as to faster dissipate heat ‚Äî is useless in this environment  It simply causes faster heat absorption  resulting in a chain reaction that destroys every ship that makes the attempt to traverse the tramline even before they can return to inform others of the weakness  Sally Fowler establishes a private foundation seeking a cure for the Moties' unavoidable birth rate  The book ends on a dark note  with the mediator Charlie predicting that a later generation of humans will destroy the Motie species after the next collapse  unless a cure is actually found  In either case  it seems that Crazy Eddie was right ‚Äî the Cycles will finally end ,1,0,0,0,0
554,Stand on Zanzibar,The story is set in 2010  mostly in the United States  A number of plots and many vignettes are played out in this future world  based on Brunner extrapolation of social  economic  and technological trends  The key main trends are based on the enormous population and its impact: social stresses  eugenic legislation  widening social divisions  future shock  and extremism  Certain of Brunner guesses are fairly close  others not  and some ideas clearly show their 1960s mind set  Many futuristic concepts  products and services  and slang are presented  A supercomputer named Shalmaneser is an important plot element  The Hipcrime Vocab and other works by the fictional sociologist Chad C  Mulligan are frequent sources of quotations  Some examples of slang include codder (man)  shiggy (woman)  whereinole (where in hell )  prowlie (an armored police car)  offyourass (possessing an attitude)  bivving (bisexuality  from ambivalent) and mucker (a person running amok)  A new technology introduced is eptification (education for particular tasks)  a form of mental programming  Another is a kind of interactive television that shows the viewer as part of the program (Mr  & Mrs  Everywhere)  Genetically modified microorganisms are used as terrorist weapons  The book centres on two New York men  Donald Hogan and Norman Niblock House  who share an apartment  House is a rising executive at General Technics  one of the all powerful corporations  Using his Afram (African American) heritage to advance his position  he has risen to vice president at age twenty six  Hogan is introduced with a single paragraph rising out of nowhere: Donald Hogan is a spy  Donald shares an apartment with House and is undercover as a student  Hogan real work is as a synthesist  although he is a commissioned officer and can be called up for duty  The two main plots concern the fictional African state of Beninia (a name reminiscent of the real life Benin  though that nation in the Bight of Benin was known as the Republic of Dahomey when the book was written) making a deal with General Technics to take over the management of their country  in a bid to speed up development from third world to first world status  A second major plot is a break through in genetic engineering in the fictional Australasian nation of Yatakang (which seems to be a disguised Indonesia)  to which Hogan is soon sent by the United States  government (State) to investigate  The two plots eventually cross  bringing potential implications for the entire world ,1,0,0,0,0
555,Fallen Dragon,Fallen Dragon takes place during the 25th century  In the preceding centuries  a means of Faster than light (FTL) space travel was discovered  allowing a speed of one half of a light year per day  This led to a series of colonization efforts in a globe about 70 light years around Earth  but these ended as their costs proved prohibitive  The only major ongoing starflight efforts are carried out by the Zantiu Braun megacorporation  who use their fleet of starships to periodically plunder their colonies in technically legal asset realization raids  typically involving military occupation of the planet in question  As it is cheaper to copy technology than ship it  these efforts normally collect single samples of interesting goods  or raw materials that are expensive on Earth  Zantiu Braun is controlled by clones of Simon Roderick  who is motivated by the idea of uplifting the entire human race to his ideal  The story follows the life of Lawrence Newton from the colony planet Amethi  both in the current time and in a series of flashbacks  In the current time  Newton is a mercenary in the Zantiu Braun strategic security forces  who leads a squad of troopers wearing organic armor suits called Skin that render them practically invulnerable  As a teenager  Newton lived on the planet Amethi and is the oldest son of one of the most powerful members of the board of the corporation which controls the planet  Lawrence dreams about being a starship pilot  despite being told by his father that starship exploration is finished  Lawrence loses interest in school work and withdraws socially  His father takes him to a holiday resort  where a gorgeous girl named Roselyn breaks through Lawrence isolation  and the two develop a passionate relationship  Roselyn eventually informs Lawrence that there actually are space exploration missions through companies on Earth  Never having given up on his dream  he prepares to tell his father of his decision to leave school and overhears his father mentioning that Roselyn was paid to meet and seduce him  In a furious rage  he decides to leave Amethi immediately  and avoids detection by his father through the use of advanced quasi sentient software called Prime  given to him by his friend Vinnie  Lawrence makes it to Earth and scores well on the Zantiu Braun officer candidacy exams  but lacking sufficient shares in the company  he is limited his strategic security job  instead of his dream of being a starship captain  As a Skin  he takes part on two missions of note  which are told over a series of short vignettes  One was on the planet Thallspring  which is fairly Earth like  He is stationed in the town Memu Bay  but takes a journey through the hinterlands to the Arnoon province  During his time there he stops a trio of squaddies from a different platoon from gang raping one of the villagers  Throughout his stay  Newton is bothered by something odd about the village  which seems to have a quality of living that is well beyond what one would expect given the surroundings  He is convinced they are hiding something  but can not find out what it is  The other was on the planet Santa Chico  where the founders modified themselves at a genetic level to coexist with the planet biota  The mission goes disastrously wrong  As the colonists are no longer fully human  Zantiu Braun soldiers have trouble communicating with them  unable to fully comprehend their new lifestyle  The civilization has little in the way of centralized industry or anything of value to Earth  and remains extremely hostile to the Zantiu Braun forces  Their biological augmentations make them an equal match for the Skins  which they invented years ago  and inflict severe casualties on the asset realization force  They eventually destroy a captured asteroid in orbit in order to create a Kessler syndrome that closes the sky  making further trips to the planet impossible  Newton concludes that the asset realization concept is no longer workable; the technology levels of the colony planets are growing so quickly that future missions will be too dangerous to be worthwhile  But it is this mission that apparently solves the mystery of Arnoon  Arnoon had  in plain sight  alien plants living on unsterilized soil bearing edible fruits  This would be impossible for Thallspring technology to create  and he concludes it was provided by Santa Chico geneticists  Lawrence plans to realize their unknown wealth for himself  and to use it to buy his retirement  When he learns of another mission to Thallspring  he ensures his team is part of the contingent  In the time since the first mission  Thallspring has advanced greatly  A small group has formed an effective resistance movement in preparation for the next asset realization mission  led by Denise Ebourn from Arnoon  As a cover  Denise works in a kindergarten  where she tells the kids supposedly fictional stories about an ancient alien galaxy wide civilization and an alien prince named Mozark  Denise uses an advanced alien intelligence known as a dragon to enhance herself  her resistance cell mates  and the villagers in Arnoon  When the Z B mission arrives  her team uses their Prime software to sabotage the Zantiu Braun efforts with some effect  However  Newton  now a Sergent  also has Prime  and uses it to return his platoon to Arnoon in search of its treasure  As Denise learns that Lawrence is headed for Arnoon village she races to intercept him  A violent confrontation takes place between Lawrence platoon and a group of Arnoon villagers  ending with a wounded Lawrence staggering alone towards Arnoon village  When he gets there he and his Skin suit are spent  and he is near death  The villagers  one of whom (Denise sister) is the girl he previously saved from being raped  revives him  They reveal that their wealth comes from a damaged alien dragon with greatly advanced technological knowledge such as the nanotechnology used to enhance the resistance movement  The dragon is a spaceliving creature  which is damaged and has lost much of its memory  To repay the dragon for its help  the villagers plan to use steal one of Zantiu Braun starships to travel to a red sun  where the dragon says its species lives  After meeting the dragon and learning its story  Lawrence decides to join them  and helps them to hijack a spaceship  But they are followed by a damaged Simon Roderick clone  who is determined to use all means to capture the technology for himself  not even trusting his clone brothers  Another Simon Roderick clone follows  to get the technology and to stop his clone brother from becoming the only human to possess the powerful knowledge  Denise and Lawrence arrive at the red star and quickly find the dragons  They learn that the dragons are a disengaged race who do nothing but amass knowledge  sharing it freely with others  The Arnoon dragon was simply a seed  one out of billions  and no more important to them than a single sperm cell is to humans  Since they arrived first  Denise and Lawrence convince the red star dragon that the deranged Simon Roderick will misuse their knowledge  and the dragon disables his ship  The dragon civilization gives their patternform construction knowledge to Lawrence  Denise and to the other Simon Roderick  in an agreement arranged by Denise and Lawrence so that the knowledge will be shared freely on Earth  and not monopolized by Zantiu Braun  Lawrence uses the technology to construct the spaceship he has wanted since he was a teenager  He flies back in time through an ancient time portal  mentioned in Denise kindergarten story  and then travels to Amethi  There he uses the technology to transform into Vinnie  one of young Lawrence closest friends  After giving young Lawrence the Prime program so he can travel to Earth  Vinnie changes into young Lawrence  and goes to make up with Roselyn  The book has four separate story threads  The threads are told in parallel in the book  merging at the end  *Young Lawrence Newton life on Amethi and becoming a Zantiu Braun squaddie sergeant  *Adult Lawrence Newton life as a Zantiu Braun squaddie sergeant preparing for the asset realization expedition to Thallspring  *Denise Ebourn from Arnoon village and her resistance group preparation for and battle against the Thallspring asset realization expedition  *The alien prince Mozark journey in the galaxy wide Ring Empire  a story told by Denise Ebourn to the kindergarten children  *Limited perspective and narrative view point from Simon Roderick;

556,Count Zero, As with later Gibson works  there are multiple story line threads which eventually intertwine: Thread One: In the southwestern USA  Turner  a corporate mercenary soldier  has been hired out to help Mitchell  a brilliant researcher  make an illegal career move from Maas' corporate fortress built into a mesa in the Arizona desert to another corporation  The attempt is a disaster  and Turner ends up escaping with the scientist young daughter  Angie Mitchell instead  Her father had apparently altered her nervous system to allow her to access the Cyberspace Matrix directly  without a deck (a computer)  but she is not conscious of this  She also carries the plans  implanted in her brain by her father  of the secrets of construction of the extremely valuable biosoft that has made Maas so influential and powerful  This biosoft is what multibillionaire Josef Virek (see thread three) desires above all else  so that he can make an evolutionary jump to something resembling omniscience and immortality  Thread Two: A young New Jersey suburbs amateur computer hacker  Bobby Newmark  self named Count Zero  is given a piece of black market software by some criminal associates to test  When he plugs himself into the matrix and runs the program  it almost kills him  The only thing that saves his life is a sudden image of a girl made of light who interferes and unhooks him from the software just before he flatlines  This event leads to his working with his associates' backers to investigate similar strange recent occurrences on the Net  It is eventually revealed that Bobby mysterious savior is Angie (see Thread One); the two only meet physically at the very end of the book  Thread Three: Marly Krushkova  a small gallery owner in Paris until she was tricked into trying to sell a forgery  and newly infamous as a result  is recruited by ultra rich  reclusive (cf  Howard Hughes) industrialist and art patron Josef Virek to find the unknown creator of a series of futuristic Joseph Cornell style boxes  Unbeknownst to her  the reason behind Virek interest in these boxes is related to indications of biosoft construction in the design of one  which he suspects may be contained in the others  All of these plot lines come together at the end of the story and Virek ‚Äì the hunter of his immortality and unlimited power ‚Äì becomes the hunted  It is hinted that multiple AIs secretly inhabiting cyberspace are the fragmented  compartmentalized remains of two AIs  Neuromancer and Wintermute  having joined together (introduced in Neuromancer  and designed by the head of this Rockefeller like family  the Tessier Ashpools)  These AI units now interface with humanity in the form of different Haitian voodoo gods  as they have found these images to be the best representations of themselves through which they can communicate with people  Hackers worldwide are becoming aware that there is something weird loose in the cyberspace matrix  but most are understandably reluctant to talk about (or deal with)  voodoo spooks supposedly haunting cyberspace  The voodoo gods have constructed the elaborate series of events in the novel  having originally given Mitchell the information for developing the biosoft  instructing him to insert a biosoft modification in his daughter brain  and then sent the Cornell boxes into the world to attract  and enable the disposal of  the malicious Virek  The Cyberspace Matrix  a synergistic linked computer database that encompasses all information on Earth  has become home to sentient beings  But most of humanity remains unaware ,1,0,0,0,0
557,Mona Lisa Overdrive, Taking place eight years after the events of Count Zero and fifteen years after Neuromancer  the story is formed from several interconnecting plot threads  and also features characters from Gibson previous works (such as Molly Millions  the razor fingered mercenary from Neuromancer)  One of the plot threads concerns Mona  an innocent young prostitute who has a more than passing resemblance to famed Simstim superstar Angie Mitchell  Mona is hired by shady individuals for a gig which later turns out to be part of a plot to abduct Angie  The second story focuses on a young Japanese girl named Kumiko  daughter of a Yakuza boss sent to London to keep her safe while her father engages in a gang war with other top Yakuza leaders  In London she is cared for by one of her father retainers  who is also a powerful member of the London Mob  She meets Molly Millions (having altered her appearance and now calling herself Sally Shears  in order to conceal her identity from hostile parties who are implied to be pursuing her)  who takes the girl under her wing  The third story thread follows a reclusive artist named Slick Henry  who lives in a place named Factory in the Dog Solitude; a large  poisoned expanse of deserted factories and dumps  perhaps in New Jersey  Slick Henry is a convicted (and punished) car thief  As a result of the repetitive brainwashing nature of his punishment  he spends his days creating large robotic sculptures and periodically suffers episodes of time loss  returning to consciousness afterward with no memory of what he did during the blackout  He is hired by an acquaintance to look after the comatose Count (Bobby Newmark from the second novel  Count Zero  who has hooked himself into a super capacity cyber harddrive called an Aleph)  A theoretical Aleph would have the RAM capacity to literally contain all of reality  enough that a memory construct of a person would contain the complete personality of the individual and allow it to learn  grow and act independently  The final plot line follows Angela Mitchell  famous simstim star and the girl from the second Sprawl novel Count Zero  Angie  thanks to brain manipulations by her father when she was a child  has always had the ability to access cyberspace directly (without a cyberspace deck)  but drugs provided by her production company Sense/Net have severely impeded this ability  The story of the reclusive artist that makes cybernetic sculptures is a reference to Mark Pauline of Survival Research Labs ,1,0,0,0,0
558,Tehanu, Tehanu begins slightly before the conclusion of the previous book in the series  The Farthest Shore  and provides some information about the life of Tenar after the end of The Tombs of Atuan  She had rejected the option of life among the aristocracy of Havnor  which Ged had opened to her  and arrived on Gont  For some time she lived with Ged old master Ogion   but though fond of him  rejected Ogion offer to teach her magic  Instead  she married a farmer called Flint with whom she had two children  called Apple and Spark  and became known to the locals as Goha  It is mentioned that Ged was a bit disappointed in   and did not understand   Tenar choice of a life  This is not explicitly explained  but there are hints of her feeling a lingering guilt about having been an arrogant Arch Priestess and ordering people to be cruelly put to death  Moreover  in the beginning of The Tombs of Atuan it is mentioned that Tenar was born to a farmer family and at a young age was taken from her loving parents by the Temple servants  and that as a child she was fond of apple trees  At the book outset  with her husband now dead and her children grown up  Tenar lives on her own at Flint property Oak Farm  and is lonely and uncertain of her own identity   is she the simple farm woman Goha  or the ex Kargish priestess Tenar  She adopts the child of wandering vagabonds after the child natural father pushes her into a campfire and leaves her for dead  Tenar helps to save the child life  but the child is left with one side of her face permanently scarred and the fingers of one hand fused into a claw  Tenar gives the child the name Therru which means 'flame' in Tenar native Kargish language  Tenar learns that the mage Ogion  her former tutor  is on his deathbed and has asked to see her  She sets out to visit him at his house outside the town of Re Albi  taking Therru with her  On the way  she encounters a group of ruffians  one of whom is Handy  who was involved in the original attempt on Therru life  and claims to be her uncle  She stays with Ogion  tending to him in his last days  He instructs her to teach Therru  but his instructions are vague  and hint at her being more than she seems  After his death  she stays on at his cottage  tending to his orchard and goats and pondering her future  She befriends a local witch called Moss and a simple village girl called Heather  Her tranquil existence is dramatically broken by the arrival of Ged (also called Sparrowhawk) on the back of the dragon Kalessin  unconscious and near death  Ged   once the Archmage of Roke   has spent all his wizard powers in sealing the gap between the worlds of the living and the dead created by the evil wizard Cob  She nurses him back to health  but when the new king Lebannen sends envoys to bring him back to Roke to resume his duties as Archmage  Ged cannot face them  fearing them due to his loss of power  He accepts Tenar offer to return to Oak Farm to manage things there in her absence and flees there to take up a life as a goatherd  While at Re Albi  Tenar is confronted by the local lord wicked mage  Aspen  who attempts to put a curse on her  but is initially thwarted  Tenar informs the king men that she cannot reveal Ged whereabouts  and they accept the situation and depart  Tenar is initially unsure whether to stay or leave Re Albi  when her safety is threatened again by Aspen and Handy  so she flees with Therru  Her mind confused by Aspen magic  she is almost overtaken by Handy  but manages to escape  taking refuge in the ship of the king himself  Lebannen takes Tenar and Therru to Valmouth  where Tenar eventually returns to Oak Farm to find that Ged is away tending goats in the mountains for the season  Tenar settles back into life on the farm  until one night  several men attempt to break into the house and apprehend Therru  but are driven off by Ged  who happened to overhear and follow them on their way toward the farm  Tenar and Ged begin a relationship  acknowledging that they had always loved each other  Ged wants nothing more than to settle down and live an ordinary life  far from the concerns of an Archmage  Together  they teach and care for Therru and manage the farm  The order is upset however when Tenar son Spark returns home suddenly from a life as a sailor and tells her he wishes to run the farm  Under Gontish law Oak Farm belongs to him and Tenar has no claim to it  Before they have time to work out what will happen  Tenar hears word that Moss is dying and wants to see Tenar  She  Ged and Therru leave immediately for Re Albi  However  the message was a trap set by Aspen  who reveals himself to be a follower of the defeated wizard Cob  who despises Ged and Tenar  and fears Therru  When Tenar  under Aspen curse  leads Ged toward the lord mansion  Therru escapes  Ged is powerless to prevent Aspen from capturing the two and holding them prisoner  beating and humiliating them in the process  especially Tenar  Meanwhile  Therru runs to the cliff behind Ogion cottage  where she calls to the dragon Kalessin for help  and reveals her true nature: she is in fact a double being  half human  half dragon  Aspen and his followers bring both Tenar and Ged up to the clifftop  Under the influence of Aspen spell  they are both just about to jump to their deaths when the dragon Kalessin arrives and burns and crushes Aspen and his men to heaps of ash and rags  Kalessin addresses Therru by her true name Tehanu  calling her his daughter  and asks her if she would like to leave with him  but she decides for now that she will stay with Tenar and Ged  The novel ends with all three of them settling down to a simple life of farming and goat keeping at Ogion old cottage  There is  however  the clear suggestion that Tehanu is the woman on Gont who is destined to ultimately become the Archmage at the Magic School of Roke  Obviously  innately knowing as her mother tongue the True Speech which is the basis of all magic   rather than having to spend years in laboriously learning it  as ordinary mages need to do   would give her an enormous head start  Also  already as an untrained child  she is by definition a dragon lord   i e   a person which dragons talk to   a distinction which only a few grown mages achieve even at the height of their power ,1,0,0,0,0

565,Star Maker, The book begins with a single human narrator from England who is  via unexplained means  transported out of his body and finds himself able to explore space and other planets  After exploring a civilization on another planet in our galaxy at a level of development similar to our own that existed millions of years ago thousands of light years from Earth (the Other Earth) in some detail  his mind merges with that of one of its inhabitants  and as they travel together  they are joined by still more minds or group minds  This snowballing process is paralleled by the expansion of the book scale  describing more and more planets in less and less detail  The disembodied travellers encounter many ideas that are interesting from both science fictional and philosophical points of view  These include the first known instance of what is now called the Dyson sphere  reference to a scenario closely predicting the later zoo hypothesis or Star Trek Prime Directive  many imaginative descriptions of species  civilizations and methods of warfare  and the idea that the stars and even the pre galactic nebulae are intelligent beings  operating on vast time scales  A key idea is the formation of collective minds from many telepathically linked individuals  on the level of planets  galaxies  and eventually the cosmos itself  The climax of the book is the supreme moment of the cosmos  when the cosmical mind (which includes the narrator) attains momentary contact with the Star Maker of the title  The Star Maker is the creator of the universe  but stands in the same relation to it as an artist to his work  and calmly assesses its quality without any feeling for the suffering of its inhabitants  This element makes the novel one of Stapledon efforts to write an essay in myth making  After meeting the Star Maker  the traveller then explores earlier drafts of the universe  which he refers to as toy cosmos  including a universe composed entirely of music with no spatial dimensions  and a triune universe which closely resembles Christian orthodoxy (the three universes respectively being hell  heaven  and reality with presence of a savior)  The novel ends with the traveller returning to Earth ,1,0,0,0,0
566,Player Piano, Player Piano is set in the future after a fictional third world war  During the war  while most Americans were fighting overseas  the nation managers and engineers faced a depleted work force  and responded by developing ingenious automated systems that allowed the factories to operate with only a few workers  The novel begins ten years after the war  when most factory workers have been replaced by machines  The bifurcation of the population is represented by the division of Ilium into The Homestead  where everyone who is neither a manager or engineer lives  and the other side of the river  where all the engineers and managers lives  Player Piano develops two parallel plot lines that converge only briefly  and insubstantially so  at the beginning and the end of the novel  The more prominent plot line follows the protagonist  Dr  Paul Proteus (hither to referred to as Paul)  an intelligent  thirty five year old factory manager of Ilium Works  The ancillary plot line follows the American tour of the Shah of Bratpuhr  a spiritual leader of six million residents in a distant  underdeveloped nation  The purpose of the two plot lines is to give two perspectives of the system: one from an insider who is emblematic of the system  and one from an outsider who is looking in  Paul  for all intents and purposes  is the living embodiment of what a man within the system should strive to be  while the Shah is a visitor from a very different culture  and therefore applies a very different context to happenings he sees on his tour  The main plot line follows the metamorphosis of Paul from being within the system to being against the system  At the beginning of the novel  Paul displays a sense of dissatisfaction with the industrial system and his contribution to society  Symbolically  he reflects on his colleagues' desire to destroy an old building  once a part of Edison factory  which he saves and instead keeps it alive to store new machinery  Looking for salvation from a yet unknown plight  he gets a knock at his door  figuratively speaking  and Ed Finnerty  an old friend whom Paul has always held in high regard  informs him he has quit his important engineer job in Washington D C  Paul and Finnerty visit a bar in the Homestead section of town  where workers who have been displaced by machines live out their meaningless lives in mass produced houses  There  they meet an Episcopal minister  named Lasher  with an M A  in anthropology  who puts into words the unfairness of the system that the two engineers have only vaguely sensed  They soon learn that Lasher is the leader of a rebel group known as the Ghost Shirt Society  and Finnerty instantly takes up with him  Paul is not bold enough to make a clean break  as Finnerty has done  until his superiors ask him to betray Finnerty and Lasher  He quits his job and is captured by the Ghost Shirt Society; he is forced to join as their leader but only in name  Paul father was the first National  Industrial  Commercial Communications  Foodstuffs  and Resources Director‚Äù As his lengthy title suggests  Dr  George Proetus has almost complete control over the nation‚Äôs economy and was more powerful than the President of the United States  Through his father success  Paul name is famous among the citizens  so the organization intends to use his name to their advantage by making him the false 'leader' to gain publicity ,1,0,0,0,0

569,Singularity Sky, The apparent cause of this distribution of humans is the mysterious and immensely powerful posthuman entity which calls itself the Eschaton  Although the Eschaton is usually benign and uninvolved in human affairs  it strictly enforces certain rules on human civilization out of apparent self interest  To this end  the Eschaton has helpfully left a message throughout human space  for example  engraved in huge letters on the sides of mountains  and dispersed everywhere throughout computer networks  The message is as follows: :I am the Eschaton  I am not your God  :I am descended from you  and exist in your future  :Thou shalt not violate causality within my historic light cone  Or else  The most important commandment of the Eschaton appears to be thou shalt not violate causality; that is  the Eschaton strictly prohibits the use of faster than light travel for reaching any point in its own relative past  with the ominous proscription or else  The Eschaton apparently makes use of time travel itself  but whenever a civilization attempts to break this rule  it is forcibly prevented from doing so immediately before the act (often with immense overkill  such as in at least one case where the relevant civilization star is induced into going supernova)  Inscrutable  and uncommunicative beyond disseminating the knowledge of its laws  the Eschaton generally does not provide further warnings before it acts  The Eschaton other major involvement is that at a particular point in the book history  it scattered pieces of human civilization  against their will  throughout nearby (within a few thousand light years) space  but it did so using instantaneous travel  and in some cases actually moved them backwards in time  This means that some civilizations  such as the Festival mentioned below  have been progressing for hundreds of years on their own before they encounter the rest of human civilization  Although human civilization on Earth collapsed in the wake of singularity  by the time of the events in Singularity Sky  Earth has recovered and become one of the more powerful and influential human societies  The Earth non government  known as the United Nations and descended from the modern day Internet Engineering Task Force  uses its agents to prevent other civilizations from breaking the Eschaton rules so as to avoid the Eschaton taking enforcement action which may affect the very existence of Earth and the wider galaxy spanning human race  Unknown to human civilization at large  the Eschaton also has its own human agents working to this end  The novel features the exploits of one such agent  Martin Springfield  an engineer specializing in faster than light starship engines who is hired by the New Republic (a totalitarian and relatively backward neo luddite civilization) to upgrade the faster than light engines of their fleet of warships  The UN also suspects that the New Republic may attempt to use the upgraded engines to violate causality  so it dispatches one of its agents  Rachel Mansour  to the New Republic  This attempt comes to pass sooner than expected  when the New Republic colony on Rochard World encounters the Festival  a spacefaring transhuman civilization/entity which trades highly advanced technology if prospective recipients can respond to the request: entertain us  The old world order on Rochard World quickly breaks down under this onslaught  Interpreting the failure of communications with the colony as the result of enemy action  the New Republic dispatches a mighty war fleet to Rochard World  with Martin Springfield and Rachel Mansour aboard the flagship  A recurring theme of this book is that information and by extension progress are inexorable: the conflict between the neo luddite/monarchist New Republic and the post singularity transhuman culture that contacts them is utterly devastating for the status quo of the former  and our spy heroes are world weary enough to realize this  exasperated by their apparent inability to understand that one can no more avoid change than one can avoid breathing  Information is  by whatever mechanism  the phlogiston of said change  providing its vital energies ,1,0,0,0,0
570,Ozma of Oz, Uncle Henry has been ordered by his doctor to take a vacation from his Kansas farm to Australia  He and his niece Dorothy Gale (this is the first of the Oz books in which the reader learns her last name) are aboard a steamship traveling there when they are caught in a fierce storm and separated  Dorothy is tossed overboard in a large poultry crate along with Billina  a yellow hen that was also on the ship  Dorothy and Billina wash ashore and pick something to eat from a lunch pail tree  She guesses that they are in a fairy country because lunch pails do not normally grow on trees and animals like Billina do not talk  but it is not Oz because that country has no seashore  They come across a message inscribed in the sand: BEWARE THE WHEELERS! Soon they meet these gaudily dressed  loud yelling creatures who have wheels instead of hands and feet  and roll around on all fours  Dorothy and Billina climb a rocky mountain to escape them and find a door carved into its side  Having found the key by the door  they open it and find Tik Tok  a round copper mechanical man whom they activate by winding up all three of his clockwork motors (one each for thinking  motion and speech) with the key like a wind up toy  Tik Tok tells Dorothy and Billina about the Land of Ev where they are now and the loss of its royal family to the magic of the Nome King  He takes them to safety from the Wheelers to the royal residence where the head exchanging Princess Langwidere (the niece of the deceased king of Ev) locks them in a high tower  Tik Tok stops in mid motion unable to move again until he is wound up with the key  Ozma and her companions (many of whom appeared in the two previous Oz books) cross the Deadly Desert with the aid of a magic carpet provided by Glinda the Good Witch to free the royal family of Ev  and Ozma has Dorothy released from Princess Langwidere custody  Cheerful reunions are had by the Scarecrow  the Tin Woodman  and the Cowardly Lion  and new introductions are made to Ozma and the Hungry Tiger  a massive tiger hamstrung by his conscience  The expedition journeys to the underground kingdom of the Nomes  where the Nome King reveals that he has turned the royal family into ornaments around his palace  The Oz people are given the option to guess which ornaments they are (he does not reveal that they are royal purple ones)  but if they fail  they will also become ornaments  Ozma  the twenty seven soldiers of the Royal Army of Oz  the Scarecrow  the Tin Woodman  and Tik Tok all suffer this fate (Dorothy escapes it only by touching a purple ornament in one of her guesses)  When the guests from Oz retire one night  Billina learns which of the Nome King ornaments were once people and about the magic belt that he wears  Billina was originally not going to be allowed to guess  but she so infuriates the Nome King by laying an egg (poisonous to any Nome) under his throne that he lets her guess  All of her guesses turn out to be right  thanks to her learning his transformation secrets  He commands his army to recapture all of them by force  but Dorothy takes the magic belt  the Army sole private takes the offensive  and Billina eggs are left in the Nomes' paths so they do not dare follow  After returning the royal family of Ev (the queen mother  five boys  and five girls) to their rightful place  Ozma  Dorothy  and the others return to Oz where a great victory celebration is held in the Emerald City  Dorothy is officially made a Princess of Oz  Billina elects to remain in Oz  and Ozma uses the magic belt to send Dorothy to Australia to be reunited with Uncle Henry ,0,1,0,0,0
571,Prey,The novel is narrated by the protagonist Jack Forman  who is an unemployed software programmer who used to work for a company called Media Tronics when he was fired for discovering an internal scandal  As a result  he is forced to take the role of a house husband while his wife Julia serves a high ranking employee at a nanorobotics company called Xymos  Julia claims that she is working on a new piece of revolutionary imaging technology with her company  which takes up most of her time  He starts believing that during her long hours away from home she is having an affair  and becomes watchful of her changes  One night Julia comes home late and shows Jack a video of her demoing the Xymos nanobots  In the video  the nanobots are put into a human test subject  and video from inside the body is broadcast in real time  The next day  Julia is injured in a car accident  and Jack is offered a job by Xymos  because the project manager  Ricky  is having software issues with the nanobots  Jack is taken to the Xymos research facility in the desert  Jack is given a tour of the lab and meets the programming team  He is shown a very complicated machine used to make the nanobots  Ricky refuses to show Jack the source code for the nanobots  and later Ricky claims that building contractors failed to properly install filters in a certain vent in the building  As a result  hazardous elements such as the assemblers  the bacteria  and the nanobots were blown into the desert  evolving and eventually forming autonomous swarms  These swarms appear to be solar powered and self sufficient  reproducing and evolving rapidly  The swarms exhibit predatory behavior  attacking and killing animals in the wild  using code that Jack himself worked on  Most alarmingly  the swarms seem to possess rudimentary intelligence  the ability to quickly learn and to innovate  The swarms tend to wander around the fab plant during the day but quickly leave when strong winds blow or night falls  The nanoswarm kills a rabbit outside the complex  and Jack goes outside with Mae to inspect  They find that the rabbit died of suffocation resulting from the nanobots blocking its bronchial tubes  While Mae goes inside for equipment  Jack is attacked by the swarms  He barely manages to get through the airlock inside the lab before falling unconscious from anaphylactic shock  Persuaded by Jack  the team decides to destroy the swarm  They believe that the swarm must have nested in the desert to reproduce  They attempt to find this nest by tagging the swarm with radioactive isotopes and following them back to their nest at night  Under the cover of a strong wind that forces the swarms to remain dormant  the team goes outside to a storage shack to find the isotopes and build a spray device  However  as the wind dies down  four swarms attack the shack and eventually kill David and Rosie  The rest of the team are forced to take shelter in the cars parked outside  The Swarms begin an attempt to enter the cars  Eventually  the swarms find a way to enter the cars  but not long before the wind picks up in speed again  Jack and Mae manage to escape to the lab before losing consciousness  but Charley falls unconscious outside his car after he sprays his swarm with the isotope  Bobby  Vince and Ricky refuse to go outside and help Charley  Jack  dizzy and nauseous  goes back out again to save Charley as the swarms attacks again  Using a motorbike found in David car  Jack manages to get himself and the semi conscious Charley to the safety of the airlock before he falls unconscious again  As night falls  Jack  Mae and Bobby set out to find the swarms  While searching for them  they discover that one of the swarms  now so evolved that it can operate without solar energy  is moving the now deceased Rosie through the desert  They follow the body to find the swarms nesting in a cave  As some of the swarms come out of the cave after them  a Xymos helicopter arrives and traps the swarms inside the cave using its powerful draft  Mae and Jack then venture into the cave and proceed to exterminate the swarm  their nest and their organic assembly plant (which looks very similar to the original Xymos assembly plant) using explosive thermite caps  They return to the Xymos plant  exhausted  At the plant  Jack  Mae and Bobby are enthusiastically greeted by Julia  who was earlier discharged from the hospital and was brought in by the chopper  Julia behavior seems to be extremely aberrant: She seems to pay heed to nothing other than trying to entice Jack and kissing him  even when Charley is found dead in the locked communications room with a swarm flying around him and the communication links cut  Jack cannot understand how the swarm got inside the rigorously protected airtight building  why Charley would have disabled the facility communications  or why Julia and Ricky seem to be coming up with various out of character ways of how he died  To Jack horror  the video not only reveals that Julia and Ricky had an affair but also shows how Charley engaged in a vicious fight with Ricky and Vince  All of them end up in the communications room where Julia kisses a subdued Charley  injecting a stream of swarm into his mouth  Eventually  Jack and Mae realize that everyone in the facility except themselves have been infected by a symbiotic version of the nanobot swarms  These nanobots  although evolved alongside the other swarms  do not show aggressive predatory behavior  Instead  while they seem to invigorate their hosts' physical statistics and their perception  they slowly devour and take over their hosts  initially affecting their decisions and then controlling them  while allowing them to travel and contaminate others  Jack comes up with a plan to destroy this new strain  Mae and Jack drink vials containing a form of phage that kills the nanobot producing E  coli bacteria  The phage would protect them from infection  Jack then proceeds to take a sample of the phage and pour it into the sprinkler system and drench everyone with it  He tricks Mae into alerting Julia and the infected team  They set out to stop Jack  In the vicious struggle that ensues  Vince is killed and Jack  who barely escapes death several times  finally manages to place the sample into the sprinkler system  In order to prevent the sprinkler system from triggering  infected Ricky disables the plant safety network  However  this is exactly what Jack wants  as Mae has already allowed the phage into the assembly line  causing the phage to reproduce rapidly  The assembly line is rapidly overheating because of the no longer active safety system  If Ricky and Julia do not turn on the safety system the assembly line will burst  filling the lab with the phage  The infected team  who are now doomed either way  choose to re activate the safety network and get drenched with the phage  Jack and Mae escape the facility in a helicopter shortly before the facility explodes due to a methane gas leak combined with thermite Mae has placed in the building  After returning home  Jack infects all his children with the phage to eradicate the potential nanobot infestation  Mae calls the United States  Army and sends a sample of the phage to her lab  Jack puts together all the missing links  The corrosion of the memory chip in Eric MP3 player as well as Amanda rash were caused by gamma assemblers  The MRI strong magnetic field detached the assemblers from her  These assemblers were most likely brought home by Julia  Knowing this  Julia called in the Xymos special team to scan Amanda room  The person who Jack spotted in Julia car was in fact the cloud of nanobots  Xymos intentionally released the swarm into the desert so that it would evolve to stay in a cohesive group in the wind ,1,0,0,0,0

573,Rocannon World,The novel begins with a prologue called Semley Necklace  which was first published as a stand alone story titled Dowry of the Angyar in Amazing Stories (September 1964)  A young woman named Semley takes a space voyage from her unnamed  technologically primitive planet to a museum to reclaim a family heirloom  not realizing that  while the trip will be of short duration for her  many years will elapse on her planet  She returns to find her daughter grown up and her husband dead  The story in effect combines the Rip Van Winkle type fairy tale‚Äîwhere a person goes underground in the company of dwarves or elves  spending an apparently brief time but on emerging finding whole generations had elapsed‚Äîwith modern science fiction having the same effect through relativity and the time dilation resulting from traveling at near light velocities  In the story  the planet dwarves live underground and have an early industrial society that (unlike industrial societies in Earth history) does not interfere with the less developed societies on the surface  The interstellar society of the Ekumen has placed an automated spaceship at the dwarves' disposal  with which Semley travels  Semley descends into the dwarves' tunnels  like Rip van Winkle  from where she makes the flight   and returns after a generation (sixteen years) due to relativistic time dilation  The novel then follows Rocannon  an ethnologist who meets Semley at the museum  He later goes on an ethnological mission to her planet  Fomalhaut II  He places the planet under an 'exploration embargo' in order to protect the native cultures  Unbeknown to him and his colleagues  there is a base on the planet of an enemy of the League of All Worlds   a young world named Faraday  which embarked on a career of interstellar war and conquest  and which chose this primitive world as the location of a secret base  After the enemy destroys his ship and his companions  Rocannon sets out to find their base so that he can alert the League of their presence with the enemy ansible  However  with his advanced means of transport destroyed  he must use other means of travel  such as on the back of windsteeds  basically large flying cats  as well as by boat or walking  His long and dangerous quest  undertaken with loyal companions from the Angyar  a local feudal culture  takes him through many lands  encountering various other cultures and species and facing numerous threats having nothing to do with the one he intends to confront  He identifies five species of highly intelligent life forms (hilfs)  the dwarfish Gdemiar  the elven Fiia  the rodent like Kiemhrir  the nightmarish Winged Ones  and the most human species  the Liuar  Increasingly  as the plot progresses  his experiences impact his personality and make him more attuned to the planet culture and changes him from the interstellar sophisticate he had been  He encounters an entity in a mountainside cave and in exchange for giving himself to the planet  he receives the gift of Mindspeech  a form of telepathy  Finally  after traveling halfway across the globe  and suffering much loss and bereavement  he reaches the enemy stronghold which had been set up in a heretofore unknown land occupied by far distant relatives of the Angyar in whose strongholds in the northern continent his journey had begun  Rocannon reverts from the effective role of a Bronze Age hero  into which he had been increasingly pushed during most of the book  back to being the resourceful operative of an interstellar civilization  He uses his mindspeech abilities to both plan and successfully infiltrate the enemy base where he uses an ansible in one of the parked ships to alert his people  A Faster Than Light (FTL) unmanned ship (as life cannot survive FTL travel in the Hainish universe) destroys the installation following Rocannon escape  Being telepathic  Rocannon feels the hundreds of deaths which he had caused at the moment when they happen   and while recognizing the need to have taken this action  he feels deeply guilty and is further traumatized  in effect burned out and incapable of ever initiating any further action  After the completion of his quest  Rocannon retires with the Angyar of the south continent  surrounded by sympathetic people and with a loving woman at his side  When rescuers from the League finally arrive 9 years later  restricted to relativistic travel below light speed  they find him dead  and slowly becoming a part of mythology  He would never know that the planet had been named Rokanan after him ,1,0,0,0,0

the armies of Regos and Coregos sought to invade Pingaree  but their advance was repelled by Pingaree king with the help of three magic pearls given to him by the Mermaids  The Blue Pearl gave the king superhuman strength  the Pink Pearl protected him from any form of harm  and the White Pearl provided words of wisdom that only he could hear  Buoyed by the Pearl magic powers  the king of

the pearls  All of the buildings are torn down  and all of the people are carried into slavery  The only ones remaining on the island are Inga  who was able to successfully hide by climbing a tree  Rinkitink  who escaped his pursuers by falling into a well  and Bilbil the goat whom the invaders did not see any value of  Inga realizes the only way he will be able to free his family and people is with the help of the magic pearls  so he comes to the palace floor to retrieve them  To make sure the pearls are not lost  he hides one each in the toes of his shoes and carries the speaking White Pearl with him  The White Pearl guides him to a boat the following morning  which he  Bilbil  and Rinkitink begin to row toward the island of Regos  Regos and Coregos are respectively ruled by a wicked king and queen  King Gos and Queen Cor  These two ruthless tyrants see no reason they cannot capture and enslave Inga and his companions as they did the rest of Pingaree inhabitants  However  none of King Gos of Regos‚Äô forces can lay a hand on Inga  Rinkitink  or Bilbil when they are touching each other due to the Pink Pearl power  They stride into the royal palace with the strength conferred by the Blue Pearl and force Gos and his evil forces to flee the island to Coregos and then free the king slaves  Inga and Rinkitink wake the next morning to find the Pink Pearl is gone&mdash;it was in the shoe that Rinkitink carelessly threw at a howling cat the previous night  While out searching for the lost shoe  the royal maid cleans their room and  finding the other shoe

585,The Time Ships,After the events related in The Time Machine  the Time Traveller (his first name  Moses  is given in the novel but applied to the Time Traveller younger self) prepares  in 1891  to return to the year 802 701 and save Weena  the Eloi who died in the fire with the Morlocks  He reveals that the quartz construction of the time machine is suffused with a radioactive substance he calls Plattnerite for the mysterious benefactor who gave him the sample to study twenty years earlier  in 1871  The Time Traveller departs into the future and stops in AD 657 208 when he notes the daytime sky has gone permanently dark  He arrives and is abducted by a branch of Morlocks more culturally advanced than the ones he met before  One of their number  Nebogipfel (the name of a character from Wells' The Chronic Argonauts)  explains after hearing the Time Traveller own story that the conflict between Eloi and Morlocks never occurred due to the Writer publication of the story that became The Time Machine  The timeline he sought to go to is inaccessible to him now  The Morlocks of this timeline have constructed a Dyson sphere around the inner solar system and use the Sun energy to power it  Humans as the Time Traveller knows them live on the sunlit inner surface of the Sphere while the Morlocks live on the outer shell  The Time Traveller convinces Nebogipfel that he will help him understand the time traveling mechanism of the Time machine if the Morlock takes him back to it  When he thinks he is unobserved  the Time Traveller reactivates his machine and travels to 1873 to persuade his younger self to stop his research on Plattnerite  Nebogipfel  who took hold of the Time Traveller once he realized what he was doing  follows him there  As the Time Traveller attempts to persuade his younger self  whom he asks to call Moses to avoid confusion  to stop his research by providing Nebogipfel as proof that reality is changed by time travel  a tank like Juggernaut pulls into Moses' yard  The army personnel on board  commanded by Hilary Bond and accompanied by an older version of the Time Traveller friend Filby  take Moses  Nebogipfel  and the Time Traveller to their 1938  where World War I has stretched over twenty four years due to the discovery of time travel which was influenced by the latter work  Britain major cities are all encased in Domes  and with the contributions of Austrian expatriate Kurt G√∂del  the government hopes to win the war by altering Germany history conclusively  Nebogipfel explains to the Time Traveller that they've entered another future as a result of their actions in Moses' past  During another bombing raid on London by the Germans  G√∂del provides a vial of Plattnerite and leads to the only escape available  a Time Car prototype  Upon hearing this and what society would be like after the war (a pessimistic view mirroring Wells' own)  the Time Traveller and Nebogipfel mount the vehicle and insert the Plattnerite  Moses is killed in an explosion when he tries to save G√∂del  and the Time Car travels back to the Paleocene and is wrecked on a tree  After weeks of bare survival  the Time Traveller and Nebogipfel are discovered by a scouting party from the Chronic Expeditionary Force commanded by Hilary Bond that arrived from 1944 to find them based on their remains in her time  Some time later  a German Messerschmitt plane arrives over the campsite  drops a Carolinum bomb (analogous to an atomic bomb in our world; see Wells The World Set Free)  and devastates the time traveling Juggernauts and all but twelve of the Force  Nebogipfel and the Time Traveller are away from the campsite at the time  Over the next year and a half  the stranded soldiers under Hilary Bond command start the colony of First London  In off moments  Nebogipfel has worked on repairing the Time Car and acquired shavings of Plattnerite to power it on a journey through time  When the Time Car is ready  the Time Traveller joins Nebogipfel in a fifty million year journey through which they see First London expand and develop colonies on the moon and in Earth orbit  Eventually  human tampering with the Earth environment renders the planet uninhabitable  and they depart for the stars  When the Time Car finally stops due to loss of its Plattnerite fuel  Nebogipfel and the Time Traveller are tended by a Universal Constructor  a life form (or lifeforms) composed of thousands of nanotechnological entities  They see that there are few stars left in the night sky; this is due to the human descendants colonizing many worlds and constructing Dyson Spheres around the host star  The goal of the Universal Constructor is to harvest the energy of the sun to build time travel vehicles from Plattnerite and travel to the beginning of the universe  However  this goal is not due to be completed for a million years  Nebogipfel and the Time Traveller acquire enough Plattnerite from the Constructors in order to journey to the point in the future (i e   another million years hence) when the Constructors will have finished building their time ships  Once the Time Traveller and Nebogipfel reach this point  the Constructors integrate them into a time ship and thus begins the journey back to time beginning  At this central point from where all matter and energy and timelines branch off  the Constructors apparently start a new history in which they become something even more grand and knowledgeable than before  These successors of the Constructors place the Time Traveller and Nebogipfel into the Time Traveller original history in the year 1871  It is revealed that the Time Traveller himself is the mysterious stranger who gave his younger self the Plattnerite sample under the alias Gottfried Plattner  and that because of this  the circle of causality is closed and thus  the whole multiplicity of histories which ends up creating the Constructors and their successors begins anew  Nebogipfel  with his consciousness enhanced by his time with the Constructors  leaves the Time Traveller behind to travel with the successors of the Constructors  These successors plan to travel beyond the local multiplicity into a new realm of historical dimensions  The Time Traveller then makes one final journey to AD 802 701  along his historical axis  and just barely saves Weena from the death she suffered before  Since (the reader is led to suppose) traveling in time again would cause this reality to branch off and become inaccessible again  the Time Traveller destroys the machine and encourages the Eloi in an Agrarian Revolution to reduce their dependence on the Morlocks for food and clothing  hoping to one day eliminate it entirely  As he works  the Time Traveller writes down the recounting of his adventures and seals them in a Plattnerite packet  a time capsule  so to speak  in the hope that it will travel in time to a faithful scribe  Before sealing the packet  the Time Traveller writes that he plans to go into the world of the Morlocks again  hopefully to return and add an appendix to the story  The book ends by saying that no appendix was found ,1,0,0,0,0
586,Evolution, The book follows the evolution of mankind as it shapes surviving Purgatorius into tree dwellers  remoulds a group that drifts from Africa to a (then much closer) New World on a raft formed out of debris  and confronting others with a terrible dead end as ice clamps down on Antarctica  The stream of DNA runs on elsewhere  where ape like creatures in North Africa are forced out of their diminishing forests to come across grasslands where their distant descendants will later run joyously  At one point  hominids become sapient  and go on to develop technology  including an evolving universal constructor machine that goes to Mars and multiplies  and in an act of global ecophagy consumes Mars by converting the planet into a mass of machinery that leaves the Solar system in search of new planets to assimilate  Human extinction (or the extinction of human culture) also occurs in the book  as well as the end of planet Earth and the rebirth of life on another planet  (The extinction level event that causes the human extinction is  indirectly  an eruption of the Rabaul caldera  coupled with various actions of humans themselves  some of which are only vaguely referred to  but implied to be a form of genetic engineering which removed the ability to reproduce with non engineered humans ) Also to be found in Evolution are ponderous Romans  sapient dinosaurs  the last of the wild Neanderthals  a primate who witnesses the extinction of the dinosaurs  symbiotic primate tree relationships  mole people  and primates who live on a Mars like Earth  In the book epilogue  it is implied that the replicator machines sent by humans to Mars have developed sentience and high technology  unknowingly advancing the late mankind legacy in the Universe ,1,0,0,0,0

the Yuuzhan Vong want to know the location of the secret Jedi base  and if the New Republic does not provide this information within one week  they will violently destroy millions of refugee ships  As the Jedi Knights mourn the victims of the voxyn  Anakin Solo prepares a dangerous plan  He will lead a strike force made of his Force adept friends into the core of an enemy worldship over Myrkr in attempt to kill the original voxyn  There  he will come into contact with evil  sorrow  the destiny of the New Republic     and himself  The book also saw the creation of the deadly YVH 1 Droids that were built as a response to the Yuuzhan Vong invasion and the Fall of Coruscant  The Jedi find themselves in considerable danger when the Yuuzhan Vong unleash feral creatures called voxyn on them  These voxyn are aggressive  intelligent  and extremely difficult to kill  and worst of all for the Jedi  they can hunt through the Force and have been engineered specifically to hunt down Jedi  Leia Organa Solo captures one such beast but not before she is severely wounded  It is then discovered that all voxyn are clones of an original genetically modified beast native to Myrkr  the location of the Yuuzhan Vong voxyn cloning facility  In order to foil the threat posed by the voxyn  Anakin Solo and the Jedi Council consider sending a specialized all Jedi strike team to take out the cloning facility  The idea faced some resistance  mainly from Han Solo who rightly believed that the mission was dangerous and was unwilling to send all three of his children right into Yuuzhan Vong territory  Ultimately  the choice was Luke Skywalker  who is currently leading the Jedi  who thought that it was their only chance and volunteered himself for the mission  Anakin rejected his offer on the grounds that he was too valuable to the New Republic and the Jedi  as well as being too important and strong for the Yuuzhan Vong to consider taking alive  Instead  Anakin volunteers himself and others follow his lead  The final group comprises Anakin  Ulaha Kore  Jacen Solo  Jaina Solo  Tenel Ka Djo  Zekk  Tahiri Veila and Alema Rar among others  While the initial part of the mission went smoothly  things began to get out of hand once the team landed on the worldship orbiting Myrkr  While they were there  they were repeatedly ambushed by voxyn and Yuuzhan Vong warriors commanded by Nom Anor and Vergere  They also ran into Nightsister Lomi Plo and her Shadow Academy apprentice Welk  After some debate  Anakin decided that Lomi Plo and Welk should join them  although Zekk predicted that they would be double crossed by the Dark Jedi  There were several casualties along the way to the original or 'queen' voxyn  but the biggest blow fell when Anakin was injured  Already weary and injured  the Jedi soon came under attack once again and although they escaped  the damage to Anakin had already been done  They soon learned that Welk and Lomi Plo had made off with the spacecraft Anakin had intended to use for their getaway  taking with them Raynar Thul  an old friend of Jaina and Jacen  This effectively means that the group are stranded aboard the worldship with a worsening Anakin  Anakin soon realized that his condition would result in the entire group death  He died later fighting off many Yuuzhan Vong  destroying all of the voxyn cloning samples  and buying the time his comrades needed in order to escape the Yuuzhan Vong  His death was felt by his uncle Luke Skywalker and his mother Leia Solo  the former noting that before his death  Anakin had already become one with the Force  Before his death  he left his brother Jacen in charge of their group  After a brief period of mourning during which tensions within the group rose  Jacen and Jaina decided to split up  Jaina wanted to retrieve her brother body while Jacen decided to finish off their original mission; the killing of the voxyn queen  On his way there  he met the mysterious Vergere who showed him the way to the voxyn queen whom he fought and defeated  After this  she turned on him and delivered him right into the waiting hands of the Yuuzhan Vong  Jaina  meanwhile  had successfully retrieved her brother body and reluctantly led what was left of their group off of the Myrkr worldship via a stolen Vong frigate  leaving Jacen behind with the Yuuzhan Vong  Before her departure  she had already begun to show signs of dark side tendencies that rose from the loss of Anakin  The Yuuzhan Vong warfleet attacked Coruscant from the OboRin Comet Cluster  having assembled at such staging positions like Borleias  They used refugee ships containing prisoners from earlier battles to shield the Vong fleet  Even with the efforts of legendary leaders such as General Garm Bel Iblis (commanding Fleet Group Two)  Admiral Traest Kre'fey (commanding Fleet Group One)  General Wedge Antilles (commanding Fleet Group Three)  Supreme Commander Sien Sovv  and Jedi Master Luke Skywalker  the Yuuzhan Vong were too plentiful to be thwarted  It was said that the Vong fleet numbered tens of thousands  and that half of the New Republic space navy was present  Chief of State Borsk Fey'lya made Admiral Sovv command the battle in front of a full session of the Senate  As a result  the New Republic forces had no effective overall strategy  and discipline broke down  When Sovv ordered that the fleet hold their fire in order to not hit the refugee ships  Iblis flat out ignored him  and his Fleet Group operated solely under his command for the rest of the battle attacking the Yuuzhan Vong head on and suffering enormous casualties  The refugee ships  which were piloted by Yuuzhan Vong  were deliberately smashed into Coruscant shields to weaken them  This tactic worked  as eventually whole shield grids failed  and the surface shield generators exploded  Coruscant did have extensive mine fields  but these didn't have quite as large an impact as desired‚Äîthe defenders at Coruscant disabled the mines to avoid slaughtering the refugees  The Vong also used the refugee ships to batter the city planet surface  causing terrible damage below  Even the orbital defense platforms could not stop the advance of the Yuuzhan Vong  Soon Coruscant skyline was burning with crashing vessels and plasma fire from the battle above  Even Orbital Defense Headquarters was crippled  and fell out of orbit to the surface  During the battle  Luke Skywalker and other Jedi from the Eclipse base targeted the enemy war coordinating yammosks  and managed to destroy four of them  Meanwhile  Han and Leia Solo  aboard the Millennium Falcon  attempted to rescue Chief of State Borsk Fey'lya  but were tasked with rescuing Luke Skywalker and Mara Jade Skywalker  The second assault wave were thousands of yorik trema dropships  tsik seru airskimmers  swarms of yorik vec assault cruisers and coralskippers  rakamat and fire breather walkers  legions of Yuuzhan Vong warriors and Chazrach support troops  In desperation  the New Republic military fired on the hostage refugee ships but to no avail  At the Imperial Palace  Tsavong Lah aide Romm Zqar tried to force Borsk Fey'lya to surrender  When he refused  he was killed  But before the Chief of State died  he had planted a bomb in the Imperial Palace triggered by his heartbeat  This resulted in the deaths of the Chief of State  25 000 Yuuzhan Vong warriors  the destruction of a portion of the Imperial Palace  many surrounding buildings  and several Yuuzhan Vong vessels  Prior to his death  Fey'lya had ordered the data towers to be destroyed to prevent valuable information from getting into the hands of the Yuuzhan Vong  The battle lasted for several days with heavy casualties on both sides  Many of its citizens were forced to flee the former capital world of the New Republic while those who did not manage to escape were forced to flee into the city planet lower levels  Many Senators  fearing for their lives  commandeered bits of the fleet and escaped to their sectors as the battle progressed  The New Republic navy was somewhat diminished as a result  Some think that if this had not happened  then the New Republic might have won the battle  The third wave was a biotoxin in the form of green algae released by the Yuuzhan Von which devoured many of the buildings  including dead bodies  and the algae also left behind black spots  Coralskipper and yorik vec squadrons bombed the devastated city world causing damage to the defenders  The Yuuzhan Vong eventually captured Coruscant and had it terraformed and renamed Yuuzhan'tar after their primordial homeworld  Overall  the Yuuzhan Vong won because of their utter ruthlessness ,1,0,0,0,0

595,Invisible Man,In the beginning  the narrator lives in a small town in the South  A model student  indeed the high school valedictorian  he gives an eloquent  Booker T  Washington inspired graduation speech about the struggles of the average black man  The local white dignitaries want to hear  too  First  however  in the opening Battle Royal chapter  they put him and other black boys through a series of self abusive humiliations  Are these the white folk whom Washington thought blacks could look to as neighbors  Probably not  but they do give the narrator a scholarship to an all black college clearly modeled  in spite of disguises  on Washington Tuskegee University  One afternoon during his junior year  the narrator chauffeurs Mr  Norton  a visiting rich white trustee  out among the old slave quarters beyond the campus  stopping by chance at the cabin of Jim Trueblood  who unintentionally  in his sleep  committed incest with his daughter  who is now pregnant  After hearing Trueblood scandalous story  and giving him a $100  Norton feels faint and calls for a stimulant  meaning alcohol  The narrator realizes that he does not have the time to take Mr  Norton to the bars at the edge of town  and instead takes him to the Golden Day  a local tavern patronized by black World War I veterans who  presumably suffering from war related disorders  are patients at a nearby mental hospital  It is a brutal  riotous scene  and Norton is carried out more dead than alive  Small wonder that the narrator worries about the college president Dr  Bledsoe reaction: white trustees aren't supposed to know about the underside of black life beyond the campus  What the campus stands for  the vision of the unnamed Founder (Washington)  comes out in a sermon by the Reverend Homer A  Barbee  a blind but fervently dedicated upholder of that vision  The narrator is uplifted  but unfortunately  Bledsoe expels him for having mismanaged Norton afternoon  This is an important stage in the narrator understanding  Bledsoe goes so far trying to please the white power brokers that people like him  the narrator  are sacrificed  rendered invisible  Nonetheless  Bledsoe gives him several letters of recommendation  which should help him get a job that will earn him the money he'll need to return to school  Upon arriving in New York  the narrator distributes the letters with no success  Eventually  the son of one of possibilities takes pity on him and shows him an opened copy of the letter; it reveals that Bledsoe never had any intentions of letting the narrator return and sent him to New York to get rid of him  On the son suggestion  the narrator eventually gets a job in the boiler room of a paint factory in a company renowned for its Optic White paint (used to render any object  from coal to monuments to buildings  blindingly white)  The man in charge of the boiler room  Lucius Brockway  is extremely paranoid and thinks that the narrator has come to take his job  He is also extremely loyal to the company owner  who once paid him a personal visit  When the narrator tells him about a union meeting he happened upon  the outraged Brockway attacks him  They fight  and Brockway tricks him into turning a wrong valve and causing a boiler to explode  Brockway escapes  but the narrator is hospitalized after the blast  While recovering  the narrator overhears doctors discussing him as a mental health patient  He learns through their discussion that shock treatment has been performed on him  After the shock treatments  the narrator attempts to return to his residence when he feels overwhelmed by dizziness and faints on the streets of Harlem  He is taken to the residence of Mary  a kind  old fashioned  down to earth woman who reminds him of his relatives in the South and friends at the college  Mary somewhat serves as a mother figure for the narrator  While living there  he happens upon an eviction of an elderly black couple and makes an impassioned speech decrying the action  But when the police arrive soon after  the narrator is forced to escape over several building tops  Upon reaching safety  he is confronted by a man named Jack  who implores him to join a group called the Brotherhood  a thinly veiled version of the supposedly color blind Communist Party  that claims to be committed to the betterment of conditions in Harlem  and the entire world  The narrator agrees  At first  the rallies go smoothly and the narrator is happy to be making history in his new job  Soon  however  he encounters trouble from Ras the Exhorter  a fanatical black nationalist similar to  but not based on Marcus Garvey who believes that the Brotherhood is controlled by whites  Ras tells this to the narrator and Tod Clifton  a youth leader of the Brotherhood  neither of whom seem to be swayed by his words  The narrator continues his work in Harlem until he is called into a meeting of the Brotherhood  Believing that he has become too powerful an individual  this in a movement where individuals count for nothing  they reassign him to another part of the city to address the women question  After the narrator gives his first lecture on women rights  he is approached by the wife of another member of the Brotherhood  She invites him to her apartment where she seduces him  The narrator is soon called to return to Harlem to repair its falling membership in the black community  When he returns to Harlem  Tod Clifton has disappeared  When the narrator finds him  he realizes that Clifton has become disillusioned with the Brotherhood and quit  He is selling dancing Sambo dolls on the street  mocking the organization he once believed in  Soon after  Tod  resisting arrest  is fatally shot by a police officer  At his funeral  the narrator delivers a rousing speech  rallying a crowd to reclaim his former widespread Harlem support  He is criticized in a clandestine meeting with Brother Jack and other members for not being scientific in his arguments at the funeral; he angrily retaliates and Jack loses his temper to the extent that a glass eye flies out of its socket  The narrator realizes that the half blind Jack has never really seen him either  and that the Brotherhood has no real interest in the black community problems  He is trailed by Ras the Exhorter men as he returns to Harlem; buying sunglasses and a hat  he is mistaken for a man called Rinehart in several scenarios: a lover  a hipster  a gambler  a briber  and finally  a reverend  He sees that Rinehart has adapted to white society at the cost of his own identity  He decides to take his grandfather dying advice to overcome'em with yeses  undermine'em with grins  agree'em to death and destruction     and yes the Brotherhood to death by making it look like the Harlem membership is thriving when it is actually crumbling  He seduces Sybil  the wife of one of the Brothers  in an attempt to learn of the Brotherhood new activities  Riots break out in Harlem and the narrator gets mixed up with a gang of looters  Wandering through a ravaged Harlem  he encounters Ras  who now calls himself Ras the Destroyer  After escaping Ras attempt to have him lynched (by throwing a spear Ras had acquired through the leader jaw  permanently sealing it)  the narrator is attacked by a couple of white boys who trap him inside a coal filled manhole/basement  sealing him off for the night and leaving him alone to finally confront the demons of his mind: Bledsoe  Norton  and Jack  At the end of the novel  the narrator is ready to resurface because overt action has already taken place  This could mean that  in telling us the story  the narrator has already made a political statement about how change could occur  Therefore  it is storytelling and the preservation of the history of these invisible individuals that cause political change ,1,0,0,0,0

in reality  the fountain is simply leaking  He procures assistants from Camelot trained by himself  who bring along a pump and fireworks for special effects  They repair the fountain and Hank begins the banishment of the demon  At the end of several long German language phrases  he says BGWJJILLIGKKK  which is simply a load of gibberish  but Merlin agrees with Hank that this is the name of the demon  The fountain restored  Hank goes on to debunk another magician who claims to be able to tell what any person in the world is doing  including King Arthur  However  Hank knows that the King is riding out to see the restored fountain  and not resting from the chase as the false prophet had foretold to the people  Hank correctly states that the King will arrive in the valley  Hank has an idea to travel amongst the poor disguised as a peasant to find out how they truly live  King Arthur joins him  but has extreme difficulty in acting like a peasant convincingly  Although Arthur is somewhat disillusioned about the national standard of life after hearing the story of a mother infected with smallpox  he still ends up getting Hank and himself hunted down by the members of a village after making several extremely erroneous remarks about agriculture  Although they are saved by a nobleman entourage  the same nobleman later arrests them and sells them into slavery  Hank steals a piece of metal in London and uses it to create a makeshift lockpick  His plan is to free himself  the king  beat up their slave driver  and return to Camelot  However  before he can free the king  a man enters their quarters in the dark  Mistaking him for the slave driver  Hank rushes after him alone and starts a fight with him  They are both arrested  Although Hank lies his way out  in his absence the real slave driver has discovered Hank escape  Since Hank was the most valuable slave&nbsp;&mdash; he was due to be sold the next day&nbsp;&mdash; the man becomes enraged and begins beating his other slaves  who fight back and kill him  All the slaves  including the king  will be hanged as soon as the missing one&nbsp;&mdash; Hank&nbsp;&mdash; is found  Hank is captured  but he and Arthur are rescued by a party of knights led by Lancelot  riding bicycles  Following this  the king becomes extremely bitter against slavery and vows to abolish it when they get free  much to Hank delight  Sagramore returns from his quest  and fights Hank  Hank defeats him and seven others  including Galahad and Lancelot  using a lasso  When Merlin steals Hank lasso  Sagramore returns to challenge him again  This time  Hank kills him with a revolver  He proceeds to challenge the knights of England to attack him en masse  which they do  After he kills nine more knights with his revolvers  the rest break and flee  The next day  Hank reveals his 19th century infrastructure to the country  With this fact he was called a wizard as he told Clarence to do so as well  Three years later  Hank has married Sandy and they have a baby  While asleep and dreaming  Hank says  Hello Central&nbsp;&mdash; a reference to calling a 19th century telephone operator&nbsp;&mdash; and Sandy believes that the mystic phrase is a good name for the baby  and names it accordingly  However  the baby falls critically ill and Hank doctors advise him to take his family overseas while the baby recovers  In reality  it is a ploy by the Catholic Church to get Hank out of the country  leaving the country without effective leadership  During the weeks that Hank is absent  Arthur discovers Guinevere infidelity with Lancelot  This causes a war between Lancelot and Arthur  who is eventually killed by Sir Mordred  The church then publishes The Interdict which causes all people to break away from Hank and revolt  Hank meets with his good friend Clarence who informs him of the war thus far  As time goes on  Clarence gathers 52 young cadets  from ages 14 to 17  who are to fight against all of England  Hank band fortifies itself in Merlin Cave with a minefield  electric wire and Gatling guns  The Catholic Church sends an army of 30 000 knights to attack them  but the knights are slaughtered  However  Hank men are now trapped in the cave by a wall of dead bodies  Hank attempts to go offer aid to any wounded  but is stabbed by the first man that they encounter  He is not seriously injured  but is bedridden  Disease begins to set in amongst them  One night  Clarence finds Merlin weaving a spell over Hank  proclaiming that he shall sleep for 1 300 years  Merlin begins laughing deliriously  but ends up electrocuting himself on one of the electric wires  Clarence and the others all apparently die from disease in the cave  More than a millennium later  the narrator finishes the manuscript and finds Hank on his deathbed having a dream about Sandy  He attempts to make one last effect  but dies before he can finish it ,1,0,0,0,0
601,Absolution Gap,The plot of the novel takes place in four separate time periods  The bulk of the novel is contained in the 2675 and 2727 sections  Queen Jasmina of the lighthugger Gnostic Ascension wakes Quaiche  a member of her crew  from Reefersleep  She is disappointed with him; despite his promises that he would improve the crew fortunes  he has not done so  In fact  many of systems he has explored were filled with extremely valuable artifacts which he failed to detect and were picked up by other ships  As such  she gives him one last chance  Jasmina sends him to explore the star 107 Piscium and its planets  His lover  Morwenna  is sent with him in the scrimshaw suit  a sensory deprivation device which paralyzes and blinds its wearer until they remove it  On one of the moons of a gas giant he names Haldora (which also seems to disappear every so often for a few fractions of a second)  he discovers an alien bridge  whose automated defense system attacks him  He crashes and finds he does not have enough oxygen to survive until his shuttle returns from the other side of Haldora  However  Haldora vanishes and his radio signal reaches the shuttle  which races to save him at maximum acceleration  killing Morwenna  On Ararat  23 years after the events of Redemption Ark  Scorpio  a hyperpig  seeks out Nevil Clavain  who has left mainstream society  leaving Scorpio in charge  Scorpio seeks his aid in opening a capsule which has come down from space  Also with him is Vasko  a reasonably competent but na√Øve young man  They open the capsule and discover Ana Khouri  Khouri informs the colony that humanity is now at war with the Inhibitors  They are getting the relevant technology from Aura  Khouri daughter  who has been modified by the Hades Matrix  an alien data repository  However  Skade has kidnapped her from Khouri womb  Clavain and Scorpio lead a team who discover Skade in her crashed ship  which has been attacked by the Inhibitors  causing its Cryo Arithmetic Engines to malfunction and cover the ship in ice  Skade agrees to give the colony Aura in return for Clavain being tortured to death  Clavain agrees  but tells Scorpio to throw his corpse into the sea (where the Pattern Jugglers absorb him and reunite him with Galiana and Felka)  The survivors are attacked by Inhibitor machinery  but Remontoire  a Conjoiner leading the war  protects them from space  Back in the colony  the leaders debate as to what to do next  They eventually decide to leave  Meanwhile  Captain Brannigan of the lighthugger Nostalgia for Infinity has been preparing to do so  After some deliberation  some fourteen thousand of the over 150 000 colonists board the ship  and it leaves  In space they meet Remontoire  who gives them Aura technology to defend themselves  The leaders debate whether or not to go to the moon Hela (which Aura suggests they do) or Yellowstone  to help evacuate the planet  They decide to do the latter  but find they are too late; by the time they reach Yellowstone (in 2698)  it has been overrun  As the crew collect the last refugees attempting to escape the system  a minor mutiny breaks out amongst the upper echelons  in which Scorpio leadership is overturned and the other leaders take power as a group  This is due to Scorpio electing to rescue the last refugees off a shuttle that had been contaminated by the Inhibitors  After the final disputes are settled  the ship is redirected towards Hela  Rashmika Els  a 17 year old girl  leaves her home on Hela to search for her long lost brother Harbin  who left to join the Cathedrals years before  The Cathedrals were set up by Quaiche after the 2615 timeline and constantly move across Hela (making use of various propulsion systems  such as legs and tracks) to observe Haldora and its disappearances (known as vanishings)  It uses special indoctrinal viruses to maintain religious faith amongst its supporters  although certain areas  such as Rashmika town  are exempt  She joins one of the caravans  a massive vehicle composed of several smaller units  to get to the Permanent Way  where the cathedrals can be found  She has the ability to tell whenever people are lying to her  which makes Quaiche very interested in her  He uses false evidence to convince Rashmika that Harbin has become a supporter of the church  In fact he is dead  She arrives at Quaiche is Cathedral and begins working for him  In the Cathedral she suffers nightmares about a race called the Shadows  who exist in a parallel Brane to our own  Their universe has been consumed by a rogue terraforming agent and they are trying to join Rashmika  They had showed the Scuttlers  the long extinct inhabitants of Hela  how to build a machine that could bring them across  In return they would destroy the Inhibitors  However  the Inhibitors allegedly destroyed the Scuttlers first  Meanwhile  the Nostalgia for Infinity makes its presence known to Hela and offers to protect it (Quaiche has been asking various lighthuggers for protection)  Quaiche agrees and sends delegates onto the ship  who are actually soldiers  They attempt to take the ship  but the crew defeats them  Quaiche holds Khouri and Vasko hostage  as well as Rashmika (who is actually Aura)  He reveals he actually wants the ship to change Hela rotation with its engines to stop it spinning; this will permit him to keep watching Haldora eternally  without the need for moving Cathedrals  Brannigan agrees and lands  but not before he deploys a Cache Weapon on Haldora and destroys its exterior  revealing it to be the Shadows' transport mechanism  Quaiche and Grelier (his right hand man) leave with Aura  but Quaiche panics and dies falling from the shuttle  whilst Grelier is killed by Brannigan hypometric weapon when he tries to hold Aura hostage  The soldiers of the Cathedrals overwhelm Brannigan and destroy him  Scorpio arrives and rescues Aura  who suggests they take the Scrimshaw suit (now a prison for the Shadows' digital envoy)  but Scorpio advises against doing so; Remontoire has shown him a shard of material from Ararat  which matches similar ones found on Hela  He believes that the race that made them also killed the Scuttlers for talking to the Shadows  They leave the Scrimshaw suit and retreat as the Cathedral is destroyed  As they walk away  Khouri asks Scorpio why he saved the shuttle in the Yellowstone system and it is revealed that he saw her husband  Fazil  was on the passenger manifest  The prologue and epilogue of the novel are both set in roughly 3125  four hundred years after the rest of the book  An unnamed woman and her guardian are standing on the surface of a Pattern Juggler planet which is being evacuated  The woman agrees with her guardian to spend one more hour before returning to their ship  She stares up towards the stars and has the machinery in her clothing magnify one of them  revealing it to be colored green  The epilogue reveals that the woman is in fact an older version of Aura (with her protector being Scorpio)  reflecting on the events that happened after the battle on Hela  Scorpio turned out to be right; the race   known as the Nestbuilders   that wiped out the Scuttlers had been watching humanity and aided them  The Nestbuilders advised humanity to hide with them between the stars  but the humans instead used Nestbuilder weaponry to defeat the Inhibitors and cleanse human space of them  However  in doing so  they created a greater problem: the so called Greenfly machines  self replicating terraformers programmed to destroy every object in a solar system and reorganize them into trillions of vegetation filled habitats that orbited the star (behavior that is exactly the same as the threat described by the Shadows)  The Inhibitors had kept them in check  but without the Inhibitors  the Greenfly are now out of control  Nothing the humans or Nestbuilders can do has stopped them  As such  humanity is evacuating towards the Pleiades  Aura reminisces on the decision she made not to invoke the Shadows  She decides that  before she returns to the ship  she will swim with the Pattern Jugglers and warn the people they have assimilated about what is coming  She enters the ocean as the novel ends  More can be found out about the Greenfly threat in the story Galactic North  available in the book of the same name  This story outlines the origins of the greenfly and charts their progress until the year 40 000  by which point they have spread to such an extent that humans are forced to abandon the Milky Way Galaxy entirely ,1,0,0,0,0

605,The Naked Sun, Ultimately  we find out that Delmarre neighbor and fellow roboticist Jothan Leebig was working on a way of subverting the robots' inability to kill humans  This was achieved by understanding a missing word in the Three Laws of Robotics: knowingly  He used this knowledge to cause the death of Rikaine at the hands of his wife Gladia  because Rikaine was opposed to his plans  Later on  he also managed to poison the Security Secretary using a pair of robots  The key to this technique is that a robot cannot knowingly kill a human or knowingly allow a human to come to harm  But if the robot does not know that its actions will cause harm  then it will not be stopped by the Laws  The future implication of this was pointed out by Elijah  that it can be extended to the point at which robots could be used to fight wars  (In the Asimov universe  this would otherwise be unthinkable  given the Three Laws ) Leebig kills himself before he can be taken into custody  because of a very Solarian fear of human contact  The irony is that the human he was afraid of was Olivaw  a robot  Despite knowledge of Gladia guilt  Baley never discloses her role in the murder‚Äîin part because he feels sorry for her and believes that her breakdown was caused by the pressure of the Solarian way of life  He manages to have her sent to the Spacer capital planet of Aurora  where she can further her growth as a human being  something she could never do on Solaria  After investigating the murder to a satisfactory conclusion  Baley returns to Earth a hero  The information he brings back is invaluable to the government  which was predicting the downfall of Spacer societies; the similarities between the nature of Solarian society and Earth society in their closed natures suggests a fundamental flaw in the Terran society  A more thorough description of the aftereffects can be found in the sequel to the Naked Sun  The Robots of Dawn  We also discover the remote end point of Solaria odd development in Foundation and Earth  The Foundation series and the Spacer/Robot series seem originally to have been separate  though with some overlap of ideas  If the Galactic Empire is the far future  where have the robots gone  In Foundation Edge Asimov begins to supply the answer  expanded in the other sequels and prequels ,1,0,0,0,0

608,The Robots of Dawn, The book opens with detective Elijah Baley on Earth  training with his son and others to tolerate the outside  in spite of their socially ingrained agoraphobia  He is ordered to go to the police headquarters  There  he is told that the Spacer world of Aurora has requested through diplomatic channels that he go to Aurora  He is told that the mind of R  Jander Panell  a humaniform robot identical to R  Daneel Olivaw  has been destroyed via a mental block‚Äîroboticide  as Baley later terms it  The robot inventor  Han Fastolfe  has been implicated  Fastolfe  who was last seen in The Caves of Steel  is the best roboticist on Aurora  He has admitted that he is the only person with the skill to have done it  although he denies doing it  Fastolfe is also a prominent member of the Auroran political faction that favors Earth  Implication in the crime threatens his political career; therefore  it is politically expedient that he be exonerated  While en route to Aurora  Baley once again is partnered with R  Daneel Olivaw  as well as R  Giskard Reventlov  another of Fastolfe robots  On Aurora  he sets out to solve the crime  He interviews Gladia Delmarre (who first appeared in The Naked Sun; the Aurorans have given her the surname Solaria instead)  Jander was a member of her staff before he was shut down  We find out that Gladia had a secret sexual relationship with Jander  She even considered him to be her husband  Baley later interviews Fastolfe estranged daughter  Vasilia Fastolfe (although she disdains the use of her surname and prefers to use Aliena instead)  Vasilia claims that her father is a monster  and would do anything necessary to advance his theories of a science that can predict the future‚Äîpsychohistory  This includes the murder of Jander  if it would help him observe Gladia responses  Vasilia also makes clear her desire to own Giskard  who was her nanny  Following that  Baley interviews Santirix Gremionis  Gremionis is an Auroran who is attracted to both Gladia and Vasilia  With each of them  he committed the Auroran taboo of offering himself repeatedly (sexually) after they had rejected him  Gremionis denies involvement in the murder  and says he has reported Baley to the Chairman (the executive of the Auroran Government) for slander  Vasilia subtly manipulated him into falling in love with Gladia  and he realizes it only after Baley asks him about it directly  Next  Baley interviews Kelden Amadiro  Amadiro is Fastolfe chief political rival and head of the Robotics Institute  He explains the Institute political motivations‚Äîthat they wish to see Aurora and only Aurora colonize the rest of the Galaxy  Humaniform robots are an integral part of their planned colonization  although Fastolfe is the only one who can construct them  The Institute has been attempting  futilely  to construct one  On the way back to the Fastolfe residence from the interview with Amadiro  Baley airfoil (a car that uses airjets to float slightly off the ground) is forced to stop  The air compressor has been sabotaged  Baley  suspecting that it was done by Amadiro in an attempt to kidnap Daneel  orders him and Giskard to flee the car  A few minutes later  several robots arrive and interrogate Baley  Baley tells them that he ordered Daneel back to the Robotics Institute  and they leave  Baley flees the car into the thunderstorm outside  His agoraphobia gets the best of him  and he falls unconscious  He awakes in Gladia home  He is told that they had stopped not far from her house  Daneel and Giskard fled there and quickly formed a rescue party  which recovered Baley not long after he passed out  The next day  Baley goes to a prearranged meeting with the Chairman  who holds political sway over the entire situation  and is intent upon ending the crisis  Present at the meeting are the Chairman  Baley  Fastolfe  and Amadiro  Baley confronts Amadiro with a question  During Baley interview with him  Amadiro said that he knew of the relationship between Gladia and Jander  Baley asks him how he could have known of it  since it was a secret  Amadiro says he heard it from someone  but cannot remember who it was that he heard it from  Baley says that the only person he could have heard it from would have been Jander himself  Baley then gives the solution to the mystery of who killed Jander  While Gladia was on her frequent walks with Gremionis  Amadiro took the opportunity to contact Jander via trimensional viewing (telepresence) and question him  The questions would allow Amadiro to understand how Jander was designed  which in turn would allow Amadiro himself to create a humaniform robot  Apparently  this created enough entropy in Jander positronic brain to kill him  The Chairman is satisfied with this explanation  Amadiro is forced to agree to support Fastolfe policies  which are immediately put into effect  Earth benefits greatly from this  Baley  however  secretly has another suspect in mind  During his investigation  he had noticed that Giskard many times had acted as if he had knowledge of what others were thinking  He confronts Giskard  who admits it  Vasilia unknowingly gave Giskard this ability during childhood experiments  Using knowledge derived from Han Fastolfe mind  Giskard shut down Jander  This was to thwart Amadiro attempt to build humaniform robots  Giskard allows Baley to remember this knowledge of Giskard abilities  but puts a block in Baley mind that prevents him from revealing the secret ,1,0,0,0,0

614,The Iron Heel,The novel is based on the (fictional) Everhard Manuscript written by Avis Everhard which she hid and which was subsequently found centuries later  In addition  this novel has an introduction and series of (often lengthy) footnotes written from the perspective of scholar Anthony Meredith  Meredith writes from around 2600 AD or 419 B O M  (the Brotherhood of Man)  Jack London thus writes at two levels  often having Meredith condescendingly correcting the errors of Everhard yet  at the same time  exposing the often incomplete understanding of this distant future perspective  Meredith introduction also acts as a deliberate spoiler (the term did not yet exist at the time of writing)  Before ever getting a chance to get to know Avis and Ernest  how they fell in love or how Avis became politically involved  the reader is already told that all their struggles and hopes would end in total failure and repression  and that both of them would be summarily executed  This gives all that follows the air of a foreordained tragedy  There is still left the consolation that a happy end would come for humanity as a whole&nbsp;‚Äì though hundreds of years too late for Avis and Ernest as individuals; the cruel oligarchy would fall  and the two will be vindicated and respected by posterity as pioneers and martyrs  (George Orwell would forty years later specifically and explicitly deny that consolation to his Winston Smith though he confirms it in appendix  and so would other later dystopian writers ) The Manuscript itself covers the years 1912 through 1932 in which the Oligarchy (or Iron Heel) arose in the United States  In Asia  Japan conquered East Asia and created its own empire  India gained independence  and Europe became socialist  Canada  Mexico  and Cuba formed their own Oligarchies and were aligned with the United States  (London remains silent as to the fates of South America  Africa  and the Middle East ) In North America  the Oligarchy maintains power for three centuries until the Revolution succeeds and ushers in the Brotherhood of Man  During the years of the novel  the First Revolt is described and preparations for the Second Revolt are discussed  From the perspective of Everhard  the imminent Second Revolt is sure to succeed but  from the distant future perspective of Meredith  we readers realize that Everhard hopes were to be crushed for centuries to come  The Oligarchy are the largest monopoly trusts (or robber barons) who manage to squeeze out the middle class by bankrupting most small to mid sized business as well as reducing all farmers to effective serfdom  This Oligarchy maintains power through a labor caste and the Mercenaries  Labor in essential industries like steel and rail are elevated and given decent wages  housing  and education  Indeed  the tragic turn in the novel (and Jack London core warning to his contemporaries) is the treachery of these favored unions which break with the other unions and side with the Oligarchy  Further  a second  military caste is formed: the Mercenaries  The Mercenaries are officially the army of the US but are in fact in the employ of the Oligarchs  Asgard is the name of a fictional wonder city  a city constructed by the Oligarchy to be admired and appreciated as well as lived in  Thousands of proletarians live in poverty there  and are used whenever a public work needs to be completed  such as the building of levee or a canal  The Manuscript is Everhard autobiography as she tells of: her privileged childhood as the daughter of an accomplished scientist; her marriage to the socialist revolutionary Ernest Everhard; the fall of the US republic; and her years in the underground resistance from the First Revolt through the years leading to the Second Revolt  By telling the story of Avis Everhard  the novel is essentially an adventurous tale heavily strewn with social commentary of an alternate future (from a 1907 perspective)  However  the future perspective of the scholar Meredith deepens the tragic plight of Everhard and her revolutionary comrades ,1,0,0,0,0

616,Quarantine,The novel is set in the near future (2034‚Äì2080)  after the solar system has been surrounded by an impenetrable shield (constructed by either aliens or extra solar humans) known as the Bubble  The Bubble permits no light to enter the solar system  and as a consequence the stars can no longer be seen  This seems to be mere background at first  but in fact it is central to the plot  In the novel a physical process in the human brain is responsible for collapsing quantum wavefunctions representing systems into particular eigenstates  Human observations of the universe were reducing its diversity and potentiality (for instance  by rendering it uninhabitable to beings that relied on stars being something other than the enormous nuclear fusion powered furnaces human astronomers have observed them to be)  Hence it is suggested that the Bubble was constructed to prevent humanity from wreaking massive destruction on the rest of the universe through the process of mere observation  In the course of the novel  the situation is further complicated when human researchers discover a way of modifying the brain to provide conscious control over the process  allowing people to suspend wavefunction collapse at will  and to choose which state the wavefunction will collapse to  This allows a person to choose how any nondeterministic event (such as flipping a coin) will turn out  provided that he is not being observed by anyone who is still involuntarily collapsing wavefunctions  This is used to perform a variety of low probability tricks  such as tunneling through locked doors or getting past guards who happen to all be looking the other way as the person passes  The novel contains ideas not related to quantum mechanics  Of particular note is the fact that people habitually download software to run in their brains  Such neural mods (whose titles are always given in boldface  such as Sentinel or P3) are installed by insufflating several drops of fluid carrying genetically modified microorganisms  which in turn carry nanomachines capable of rewiring nerve cells  The story narrator accepts a case to investigate the disappearance of a woman from a psychiatric Institute  which leads him to the Ensemble  This is an organization that is developing a wavefunction collapse inhibitor neural mod  the eigenstate mod  This mod allows the user to stop being an observer in the sense of quantum mechanics and consequently to smear  i e  to exist in a superposition of different states at the same time and to pick eigenstates of personal preference from the range of possible states  when the personal wavefunction is collapsed  He is put under the control of the Ensemble by the forced installation of a loyalty mod in his brain which makes loyal support for the organization his highest goal  The narrator meets a group of other Ensemble loyalists (the Canon) who have discovered that their keepers have failed to specify exactly what they are to be loyal to (except by its name) and consequently  being its most loyal members  start to define what the Ensemble is themselves  The narrator  working with the Canon  then proceeds to steal the eigenstate mod  A rogue member of the Canon infects all of humanity with the software  (Normally  neither the microorganisms nor the nanomachines involved in installing neural mods can survive long outside the human body  but in this case the rogue scientist uses the eigenstate control mod to modify their properties ) As a result  causality is weakened all over the globe  and the untrained humans  not knowing what to do with their newfound freedom  break down the fabric of reality as the stars suddenly reappear in the sky then turn into an almost blinding flash as the heavens fill with lights and possibilities undreamed of    Then things suddenly are back to normal (less the loyalty mod) and two main characters debrief each other on a park bench  trying to understand how the smeared humanity was able to control events BEFORE people were all infected with the eigen mod and WHY the smeared humanity chose to return the world to normal (one theory put forward is that they reached the edge of the bubble  had a nice chat with the aliens and decided to go home and enjoy life as it was) ,1,0,0,0,0

619,The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, The two youngest Pevensie children  Lucy and Edmund  are staying with their odious cousin Eustace Scrubb while their older brother Peter is studying for his university entrance exams with Professor Kirke  and their older sister Susan is traveling through America with their parents  Edmund  Lucy  and Eustace are drawn into the Narnian world through a picture of a ship at sea  (The painting  hanging neglected in the guest bedroom that the Pevensie children were using  had been an unwanted present to Eustace parents ) The three children land in the ocean near the pictured vessel  the titular Dawn Treader  and are taken aboard  The Dawn Treader is the ship of Caspian X  King of Narnia  who was the key character in the previous book (Prince Caspian)  Edmund and Lucy (along with Peter and Susan) helped him gain the throne from his evil uncle Miraz  Three years have passed since then  peace has been established in Narnia  and Caspian has undertaken his oath to find the seven lost Lords of Narnia  Lucy and Edmund are delighted to be back in Narnia  but Eustace is less enthusiastic  as he has never been there before and had taunted his cousins with his belief that the country never existed  The Talking Mouse Reepicheep is also on board  as he hopes to find Aslan Country beyond the seas of the utter East  They first make landfall in the Lone Islands  nominally Narnian territory but fallen away from Narnian ways: in particular the slave trade flourishes here  despite Narnian law stating that it is forbidden  Caspian  Lucy  Edmund  Eustace and Reepicheep are captured as merchandise by a slave trader  and a man buys Caspian before they even reach the slave market  He turns out to be the first lost lord  Lord Bern  who moved to the islands and married a woman there after being banished from Narnia by Miraz  When Caspian reveals his identity  Bern acknowledges him as King  Caspian reclaims the islands for Narnia  and replaces Gumpas  the greedy governor  with Lord Bern  whom he names Duke of the Lone Islands  At the second island they visit  Eustace leaves the group to avoid participating in the work needed to render the ship seaworthy after a storm has damaged it  and hides in a dead dragon cave to escape a sudden downpour  The dragon treasure arouses his greed: he fills his pockets with gold and jewels and puts on a large golden bracelet; but as he sleeps  he is transformed into a dragon  As a dragon  he becomes aware of how bad his previous behaviour was  and uses his strength to help make amends  Caspian recognizes the bracelet: it belonged to Lord Octesian  another of the lost lords  They speculate that the dragon killed Octesian ‚Äî or even that the dragon was Octesian  Aslan turns Eustace back into a boy  and as a result of his experiences he is now a much nicer person  They make stops at Burnt Island; at Deathwater Island (so named for a pool of water which turns everything immersed in it into gold  including one of the missing lords who turns out to have been Lord Restimar); at the Duffers' Island  where Lucy herself encounters Aslan; and at the Island Where Dreams Come True&nbsp;‚Äî called the Dark Island since it is permanently hidden in darkness  They rescue a desperate Lord Rhoop from this last  Eventually they reach the Island of the Star  where they find the three remaining lost lords in enchanted sleep  Ramandu  the fallen star who lives on the island  tells them that the only way to awaken them is to sail to the edge of the world and there to leave one member of the crew behind  The Dawn Treader continues sailing into an area where merpeople dwell and the water turns sweet rather than salty  At last the water becomes so shallow that the ship can go no farther  Caspian orders a boat lowered and announces that he will go to the world end with Reepicheep  The crew object  saying that as King of Narnia he has no right to abandon them  Caspian goes to his cabin in a temper  but returns to say that Aslan appeared in his cabin and told him that only Lucy  Edmund  Eustace  and Reepicheep will go on  These four named venture in a small boat through a sea of lilies until they reach a wall of water that extends into the sky  Fulfilling Ramandu condition  Reepicheep paddles his coracle up the waterfall and is never again seen in Narnia (Lewis hints that he reaches Aslan Country)  Edmund  Eustace  and Lucy find a lamb  who transforms into Aslan and tells them that Edmund and Lucy will not return to Narnia&nbsp;‚Äì that they should learn to know him by another name in their own world  He then sends the children home  In their own world  everyone remarks on how Eustace has changed and you'd never know him for the same boy   although his mother believes that Edmund and Lucy have been a bad influence on him ,0,1,0,0,0
620,The Silver Chair, The story starts when Eustace Scrubb  introduced in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader  is driven into the company of classmate Jill Pole at their miserable school Experiment House  The impetus is their need to find sanctuary from the gang of school bullies who run rampant in this laissez faire and mismanaged school run by an incompetent headmistress  Eustace confides to Jill that he has recently been out of this world to a land called Narnia  and that his experiences there have led to the changes in his behaviour that everyone seems to have noticed  Jill initially believes that Eustace is lying  but when he promises and asks her to attempt to go to Narnia with him  she agrees  When the bullies are about to converge on the two  Eustace suggests asking for Aslan help  and the two blunder through a gate that leads them to a high cliff in Aslan Country  Jill shows off by approaching the cliff edge  and Eustace  trying to pull her back  falls over the edge  Aslan appears and saves Eustace by blowing him to Narnia  He charges Jill with helping Eustace find Prince Rilian of Narnia (the son of King Caspian X  he disappeared some years before)  and he gives Jill four Signs to guide her and Eustace on their quest  The fourth and final Sign is that at a key moment they will be asked to do something in Aslan name  Aslan then blows Jill into Narnia  where she arrives a few moments after Eustace‚Äîjust as an elderly and frail King takes ship and sails from the harbor  Jill remembers the Signs  and asks Eustace if he has seen an 'old friend'  They eventually realize that the departing King is actually King Caspian X  who has set off to search for Aslan or his son  Trumpkin the Dwarf  now Lord Regent and quite deaf  provides Jill and Eustace with rooms in Cair Paravel  but on the advice of Glimfeather the Owl they make no mention of their quest  Instead  they are summoned by Master Glimfeather to a Parliament of his fellow talking owls (a pun on Chaucer Parlement of Foules  but also a nod towards the use of the word parliament as a collective noun for owls)  The owls explain that Caspian son  Prince Rilian  disappeared while searching for the green serpent that killed his mother  and is under the spell of an enchantress  Jill and Eustace are flown to the marshes on the northern edge of Narnia where they are partnered with the delightfully gloomy but stalwart Marsh wiggle Puddleglum  who serves as a guide  hunter for food in the wilderness  and down to earth voice of reason  They journey toward the giant lands north of Narnia after crossing the River Shribble  The first giants they encounter take no notice of them  and the trio continue north where they encounter a deep and sinister canyon  The only route across this barrier is an enormous and ancient bridge  many times larger in scale than anything a human might normally use  Hungry and suffering from exposure  they cross the bridge and meet the Lady of the Green Kirtle accompanied by a silent knight in black armour  She encourages them to proceed northward to Harfang  the castle of the Gentle Giants  There  she tells them  they will find warm beds and hot food while the Giants celebrate their Autumn Feast  Jill and Eustace are overtaken at the thought of comfort and warmth  and forget all about the signs and the quest  with only straight headed Puddleglum arguing against the journey to Harfang  Upon their arrival  they find the Gentle Giants only too pleased to have them for their Autumn Feast  After a night of rest  the three look out a window of the castle and discover the obvious ruins of a giant city in the valley below  They also see the words Under Me engraved on the road  which they recognize as Aslan third Sign  Later they make another discovery: that the giants are planning to eat them for the Autumn Feast  After finding an unguarded door  Scrubb  Pole  and Puddleglum escape the castle only to be chased by hunting dogs and giant nobles  They take shelter in a cave under the ruined city  where they fall down a long dark slope into Underland  Battered and bruised  they are now in complete darkness; but they have followed the Sign that said Under Me  They are found by an army of earthmen  who take them aboard a boat across a Sunless Sea to the city ruled by the Lady of the Green Kirtle  Her prot√©g√©  a young man  greets the travellers pleasantly but does not seem right in the head  He explains that he suffers from nightly psychotic episodes  and during these episodes he must  by the Lady orders  be bound to a silver chair; for if he is released  he will turn into a deadly green serpent and kill everyone in sight  The threesome determine to witness the youth in his torment  as they sense it could be the key to their quest  When the young man is tied to his chair  his ravings seem instead to indicate desperation to escape an enchanted captivity  After launching a battery of dire threats  the youth finally begs his companions to release him in the name of Aslan  Recognizing the fourth Sign  they hesitantly do so  Far from their apprehension of him turning into a serpent or killing them  the young man thanks them  He declares that he is the vanished Prince Rilian  kept underground by the Lady of the Green Kirtle as part of her plot to conquer Overland  The Green Lady returns and tries to bewitch them all into forgetting who they are  The barefoot Puddleglum stamps out the enchantress magical fire and breaks her spell  The enraged Lady transforms herself into a green serpent  and Rilian realizes that he has been enslaved all these years by his mother murderer  Rilian kills the serpent with the help of Eustace and Puddleglum  and leads the travellers to escape from Underland  The gnomes  who had also been magically enslaved by the Lady  are now freed by her death and joyfully return to their home even deeper in the earth  a land called Bism  One of them shows Rilian party a route to the surface before leaving  Rilian returns to Cair Paravel as King Caspian is returning home  and Caspian is reunited with his long lost son just before dying  Aslan appears and congratulates Eustace and Jill on achieving their goal  then returns them to the stream in his country where Jill first met him  The body of King Caspian appears in the stream  and Aslan instructs Eustace to drive a thorn into the lion paw  Eustace obeys  and Aslan blood flows over the dead King  who is revived and returned to youth  Aslan explains that when Jill and Eustace return to their own world  Caspian will go with them briefly  to help set things right there  At the portal between the worlds  Aslan roars  and part of the wall surrounding Experiment House collapses  Caspian  Eustace  and Jill cross the wall and give the school bullies a sound thrashing  The beaten bullies run back towards the school in terror  having also seen Aslan  who lets them glimpse his back as part of the plan  In the confusion Eustace and Jill sneak back into the school building and change into their school clothes  while Aslan and Caspian return to Aslan country  The headmistress calls the police with a wild story of armed hoodlums and an enormous lion on the school grounds; subsequent enquiries expose her incompetence and mismanagement  The worst of the bullies are expelled and the incompetent headmistress given a new job   failing as a school inspector  she is eventually elected to Parliament  Experiment House becomes a well managed learning institution  and Eustace and Jill remain good friends ,0,1,0,0,0
621,City of Illusions,The story starts as a man is found by a small community (housed in one building) in a forest area in eastern North America  He is naked except for a gold ring on one finger  has no memory except of motor skills at a level equivalent to that of a one year old and has bizarre  amber  cat like eyes ¬† The villagers choose to welcome and nurture him  naming him Falk (Yellow) ¬† They teach him to speak  educate him about the Earth  and teach him from a book they consider holy  which is Le Guin long translated version of the Tao Te Ching  Also they teach him about the nature of the never seen Shing  After six years  Falk is told by the leader of the community that he needs to understand his origins  and as such sets off alone for Es Toch  the city of the Shing in the mountains of western North America  He encounters many obstacles to learning the truth about himself and about the Shing  along with evidence of the barbarism of current human society ¬† Along the way  it is sometimes suggested to him that the image he holds of the Shing is a distorted one; that they respect the idea of 'reverence for life' and are essentially benevolent and non alien rulers  This suggestion comes from both telepathic animals who remind him for their own self defense  and from Estrel  a young woman whom Falk meets after being captured by the Basnasska tribe in the great plains  Falk escapes this violent community with Estrel  to reach the city under her guidance  Falk finally reaches Es Toch  where Estrel betrays him into the hands of the Shing and laughs as she does so  He is told that he is part of a crew of a starship of alien/human hybrids from a planet called Werel and meets a young man  Orry  who came with him in the ship  At this point it becomes clear that Estrel is a human collaborator working for the Shing  and that she had been sent to retrieve him from the wilds of so called Continent 1  The Shing tell Falk that * they are in fact humans; * the conflict between the League and an alien invader never occurred: on the contrary  the League self destructed through civil war and exploitation; * the enemy is an invention of the Shing rulers themselves to try and ensure through fear that world peace endures under their benevolent  if misunderstood  rule; * Falk expedition was attacked by rebels who then erased Falk memory of his previous self; * and the Shing  who managed to save only Orry from the rebel attack  now want to restore Falk previous identity  Falk however believes that the Shing are non human liars and that their true intent is to determine for their own purposes  the location of his home planet  Seeing no other way forward  Falk consents to have his memory erased  The mind of the original Werelian  Agad Ramarren  is restored and the Falk personality is apparently destroyed  He emerges as a new person with pre Falk memories and vastly greater scientific knowledge  Ramarren first name  Agad  recalls Jakob Agat  one of the chief protagonists of Planet of Exile: of whom he is a descendant  However  thanks to a memory triggering mnemonic device Falk had left for himself (an instruction  through young Orry  to read the beginning of the book he travels with  his translation of the Tao Te Ching)  the Falk personality is revived  After some instability Falk and Ramarren minds come to coexist  By comparing the knowledge given to them before and after Ramarren reemergence  the joint minds are able to detect the essential dishonesty of the Shing rule and the fact that the alien conquerors can lie telepathically  It was this power that had enabled the not very numerous Shing: exiles or pirates or empire builders from some distant star  to overthrow the League of All Worlds twelve centuries before  The Werelians' mental powers are significantly greater than those of their human ancestors  The Shing are inhibited by a cultural dread of killing or being killed and would have no effective defense against any expedition that came forewarned  Still ignorant of the survival of the Falk persona  the Shing hope to send Ramarren back to Werel to present their version of Earth as a happy garden planet prospering under their benign guidance and in no need of outside help  Falk/Ramarren  now fully aware of the brutalized and misruled reality  pretends to accept this  postponing the return journey  Eventually  while on a pleasure trip to view another part of the Earth  the Shing he is with takes telepathic control of Ramarren but is then overcome by Falk  operating as a separate person  Now controlling the Shing  he makes his escape  manipulating his prisoner to show him where to find the ship that would take him home  and how to program it  (He discovers here that the Shing use a totally alien system of mathematics  quite different from the Cetian mathematics used by all human worlds ) Falk/Ramarren finally leaves for his planet  with Orry and the captive Shing who he has used  He can go back home and organize the liberation of the Earth  but this means cutting himself off from his friends there  While City of Illusions concludes at this point  Falk/Ramarren mission apparently succeeds in bringing freedom to the home world of Terra  In The Left Hand of Darkness  Genly Ai comes from Earth and remembers the 'Age of the Enemy' as something dreadful but now past  He also knows of the Werelians  now called Alterrans  The fate of the Shing is not mentioned  either there or in any later book ,1,0,0,0,0

629,The Sky So Big and Black, This story alternates between the point of view of Terpsichore Melpomene Murray (Teri)  an ecoprospector who is approaching adulthood on Mars and seeks to follow in her father footsteps  and the unnamed psychiatrist who is listening to her story  Several decades earlier  refugees from Earth fled to join a pre existing human colony on Mars to escape the domination of One True  a massively parallel/cellular automata program that runs on the interconnected brains of most of the human beings on Earth; the program in the individual human brain is called Resuna  probably a contraction from the Latin for One Thing  If a human mind has a copy of Resuna  it may remain dormant until a human speaks the trigger phrase let overwrite  let override  The first half of the novel is mostly backstory in Teri voice  leading up to the day when she passed her test for full adulthood  a legal status that can apparently be reached at any age by passing an educational and psychiatric exam  which gives her the right to marry  hold property  vote  and so forth  Teri hopes to be an ecospector (eco prospector) like Telemachus  living on the surface in a pressure suit most of the time; but because in the last generation the colonists decided to forgo terraforming Mars to suit human life and instead adapt humans to suit the Martian environment  the future of ecospecting does not look good to Telemachus; he thinks the future of Mars is with the Nations of Mars formed humans  It is estimated that modifying people can be done in just two to three generations  whereas terraforming Mars might take thousands of years  Thus he wants her to get an advanced degree and go into some always needed occupation like science or medicine  When they strike a scorehole  a very large deposit of methane and water  their fortune seems assured  and Teri expects to marry the boy she has been courting; when it turns out he has married someone else  she grumpily agrees to one more year of school at least  and she and Telemachus take on the job of shepherding a group of younger children to the school at Red Sands City  While the party are in the roundings (the frontier  bush  or outback‚Äîpossibly from surroundings or roundabouts ) a major solar flare occurs  and because Mars' thin atmosphere and weak magnetic field provide less protection against high energy particles than on Earth  this event overloads many electronics systems on Mars  as well as damaging the exosuit (space suit) systems of many people who are outdoors and otherwise unprotected  so that several members of the party are killed  including Telemachus  Furthermore  the GPS like navigation system Teri has used all her life is permanently down  Teri and Alik  a boy in the party  re invent celestial navigation and reach the nearest railhead  where there is a working phone  only to find that the disaster is planetwide and help will not be coming soon  Worse yet  a group of Marsform humans are stranded farther up the track and in danger of starving due to their ultrafast metabolisms  Despite her bigotry against the Nations  Teri tries to take food to them in a backpack  but collapses and breaks her leg  A mysterious voice on her suit radio soothes and comforts her  takes over her body  and causes her to wreck her body getting food to the Marsforms; she has been taken over by Resuna  We now learn why the psychiatrist himself has been listening to her story; they are recording it so she can have some idea of what happened in the big gaps he is going to create in her memory while erasing Resuna  He himself has had this process twice  Further  we learn that this is all information from the past  that in fact he has been re infected with Resuna  and so has Teri  and that they will both lose all memory of each other and of the many events  including much of her last memories of her father  So although they have been close friends  in the last chapter they are re introduced to each other for the first time  The novel ends with their working as ecospecting partners  as Mars rebuilds ,1,0,0,0,0

631,Camp Concentration, Poet  lapsed Catholic and conscientious objector Louis Sacchetti is sent to a secret military installation called Camp Archimedes  where military prisoners are injected with a form of syphilis intended to make them geniuses (hence the punning reference to concentration in the novel title)  By breaking down rigid categories in the mind (according to a definition of genius put forward by Arthur Koestler)  the disease makes the thought process both faster and more flexible; it also causes physical breakdown and  within nine months  death  The book is told in the form of Sacchetti diary  and includes literary references to the story of Faust (at one point the prisoners stage Christopher Marlowe Doctor Faustus and Sacchetti friendship with ringleader Mordecai Washington parallels Faust with Mephistopheles)  It only becomes clear that Sacchetti himself has syphilis as his diary entries refer to his increasingly poor health  and become progressively more florid  until almost descending into insanity  After a test run on the prisoners  a megalomaniac nuclear physicist has himself injected with the disease  joins Camp Archimedes with his team of student helpers  and sets about trying to end the human race  The prisoners in the book appear to be fascinated by alchemy  which they used as an elaborate cover for their escape plans  Sacchetti  who is obese  has a number of ironic visions involving other obese historical and intellectual figures  such as Thomas Aquinas  The novel ending may owe something to the episode Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling from the television series The Prisoner  for which Disch wrote a spinoff novel ,1,0,0,0,0

636,The Positronic Man,In the twenty first century the creation of the positronic brain leads to the development of robot laborers and revolutionizes life on Earth  Yet to the Martin family  their household robot NDR 113 is more than a mechanical servant  Andrew has become a trusted friend  a confidant  and a member of the Martin family  The story is told from the perspective of Andrew (later known as Andrew Martin)  an NDR series robot owned by the Martin family  a departure from the usual practice by United States  Robots and Mechanical Men of leasing robots  Andrew initial experiences with the Martin family are replete with awkward moments which demonstrate his lack of socialization  However  he is much better with inanimate objects and animals and begins to display sentient characteristics (such as creativity; emotion; self awareness) traditionally the province of humans  He is taken off his mundane household duties  for which he was intended  and allowed to pursue his creativity  making a fortune by selling his creations  Andrew seeks legal protection stemming from his initial creative output and eventual full recognition as a human  by gradually replacing his robotic components with organic ones  and citing the process as a transformation from robot to human  Succeeding generations of the Martin family assist him in his quest for humanity  but each is limited to what degree they are prepared to acknowledge Andrew humanity  In The Positronic Man  the trends of fictional robotics in Asimov Robot series (as outlined in the book I  Robot) are detailed as background events  with an indication that they are influenced by Andrew story  No more robots in Andrew line are developed  There is also a movement towards centralized processing  including centralized control of robots  which would avoid any more self reflecting robots such as Andrew  Only when Andrew allows his positronic brain to decay  thereby willfully abandoning his immortality  is he declared a human being  This event takes place on the two hundredth anniversary of his creation  hence the title of the novella and film ,1,0,0,0,0
637,The Currents of Space,The story takes place in the backdrop of Trantor rise from a large regional power to a galaxy wide empire  unifying millions of worlds  This story occurs around the year 11 000 AD (originally 34 500 AD  according to Asimov early 1950s chronology)  when the Trantorian Empire encompasses roughly half of the galaxy  The independent planet Sark exploits the planet Florina and derives its great wealth from kyrt  a versatile and fluorescent fiber that can only be grown on Florina  The relationship between the two planets is analogous to the situation between European imperial powers and their colonies during the 19th century  where the Florinians are forced to work in kyrt fields and are treated as an inferior race by the Sarkites  Attempts to break the Sark monopoly and grow kyrt on other worlds have thus far been unsuccessful  Meanwhile  Trantor would like to add these two worlds to its growing empire  There is a hidden irony in Sark dominion over Florina: clear parallels to the American South growing cotton with slave labor  The Florinians are one of the lightest skinned people in a galaxy where racial categories seem to have been forgotten  except by the people of Sark  One of the characters  Dr  Selim Junz  comes from Libair  a planet with some of the galaxy darkest skinned people  and feels sympathy for the Florinians  (The planet Libair takes its name from Liberia  a country in Africa  which would explain a dark skinned genetic inheritance  Liberia was also settled by freed slaves from America ) Also  Asimov chose the name of kyrt to be rather similar to cotton  and he explains that it contains cellulose  The possible destruction of Florina is predicted by Rik  a spatio analyst  who has had his mind manipulated by a psychic probe device  resulting in gross amnesia  When Rik gradually starts remembering his past  it produces a political crisis involving Sark  Florina  and Trantor  Rik  a native of the Earth  had discovered that Florina sun is about to explode into a nova because it is being fed carbon by one of the outer space currents of space  supposedly rather like the currents of the ocean  It is also revealed at long last that the special energetic wavelength of light that is being emitted by Florina sun is what causes the very high quality kyrt fiber to grow there  This is the explanation why kyrt cannot be grown on other planets ‚Äì since stars going nova are really quite rare  and stars with habitable planets that go nova are rarer still  Because losing Florina would mean losing the only source of its vast wealth  there is strong resistance from Sark to accept the message  However  when it is explained that the wealth is already lost since the conditions that enable kyrt to grow can be easily duplicated anywhere now that they are understood  they become more amenable  When Trantor offers to buy out the entire planet for a very high price  the offer is readily accepted  Even though there is not yet a full Galactic Empire  Trantor does control the now largely radioactive Earth  The idea of evacuating Earth is mentioned  but that is strongly rejected by Rik  He insists that it is the original planet of the human race  though this is not generally accepted ,1,0,0,0,0

641,Isaac Asimov Caliban, This series deals with a new type of robots who do not have the Three Laws of Robotics  The Three Laws are integral to the functioning of a positronic brain  but these robots have gravitonic brains  into which it is possible to build any set of laws  For example  some gravitonic robots have already been built with the New Laws of Robotics which are designed to make them partners rather than slaves to humanity  Caliban  the robot of the title  is an experimental gravitonic robot who was created with no laws at all  The intent was to keep him under carefully controlled laboratory conditions and see what laws he evolved for himself  but he escaped from the laboratory  and soon found himself pursued by the police (who believed that he had attempted to murder his creator) and attacked by a group of criminals who liked ordering robots to destroy themselves  The novel begins with Sheriff Alvar Kresh supervising a crime scene involving what appears to be an attempted murder of a prominent Inferno roboticist  Dr  Fredda Leving  Kresh robot sidekick  Donald  accompanies him wherever he goes  and is reluctant to follow the implications raised when Kresh sees two sets of robotic footprints leading out of the lab  for this implies that a robot committed the crime of assault on a human being  Settlers were asked to come because Inferno ecology is unstable and requires expert technical work to try and reterraform the planet to shift the planet away from potentially disastrous extremes  Tonya Welton  the leader of the Settler faction  inserts herself into the investigation hierarchy and claims that Governor Chanto Grieg wanted her involved because Leving Labs was closely associated with the Settler effort to set up a centralized terraforming depot on the island of Purgatory  It is later revealed during a lecture by Dr  Leving  that this is so the New Law robots she proposes can be safeguarded and kept from mingling with the human population as a whole  since they are designed to aid in terraforming work  and therefore represent a great investment of time and materials in order to construct  Simcor Beddle Ironhead movement stages a hit and run attack on a plantation near Settlertown  and they crop up once or twice more as the story progresses  The Ironheads nearly successfully start a riot when Beddle castigates Dr  Leving after one of her lectures on the nature of robots and how they affect human beings  It is her thesis that the superabundance of robotic labor has caused humans to become indolent and nearly incompetent at accomplishing even trivial tasks  She also claims that robots themselves do not qualify as a very good successor to humanity given that their sole purpose is to serve humans  It is revealed that some members of Leving Labs have both personal and professional secrets to hide: Gubber Anshaw is romantically involved with Tonya Welton  while Jomaine Terach is aware of the creation of Caliban and the fact that he lacked the Three Laws of Robotics  Sheriff Kresh is aided in this respect when Caliban encounters a robot at a shipping depot and recounts his entire life history (about five days' worth)  While the robot nearly seizes in brainlock and ends up precipitating a minor catastrophe by hyperwaving for help  the story the robot tells confirms what Kresh later uses to get the truth out of Terach  Caliban escapes the City of Hades (the capital of Inferno)  but is located by both Dr  Leving and Sheriff Kresh  Kresh uses the occasion to finger the true culprit in the assault on Leving  who turns out to have been Ariel  Tonya Welton personal robot  She had switched serial numbers with another robot after a test had been run on her brain and comparing it to a normal Three Law robotic brain  She  like Caliban  had been programmed without the Laws of Robotics  but had been purely a stationary unit  In switching the serial numbers  Ariel was able to have a set of robotic legs placed on her  allowing her to masquerade as a normal robot  Kresh rightly believes that Ariel presents far too great of a danger to human beings  and shoots her  However  he is convinced that Caliban does not present the same danger based on clues about his behavior  and allows him to remain functional  Caliban then goes with Dr  Leving to the island of Purgatory  fr:Le Robot Caliban,1,0,0,0,0
642,Isaac Asimov Inferno, This series deals with a new type of robots who do not have the Three Laws of Robotics  The Three Laws are integral to the functioning of a positronic brain  but these robots have gravitonic brains  into which it is possible to build any set of laws  For example  some gravitonic robots have already been built with the New Laws of Robotics which are designed to make them partners rather than slaves to humanity   in theory  This book opens with the revelation of severe political upheaval and economic dislocation in Inferno society  New Law robots  once thought to be the ideal new partners of humanity  are incited by Prospero (one of the first New Law robots to have been constructed) to leave the island of Purgatory  In this  they are assisted by a massive underground rustbacking industry precipitated by a perceived shortage of robotic labor on the rest of Inferno  Governor Chanto Grieg has initiated  and signed  a law mandating that all excess robots in a household be drafted for terraforming work  Spacers  unaccustomed to being limited to twenty robots per individual  respond by selling precious works of art or otherwise bartering for New Law robots  This funding is part of what drives the rustbacking industry  Sheriff Alvar Kresh also returns in this book  brought along largely as window dressing for the Governor  since his jurisdiction is essentially nonexistent on the Island of Purgatory  He and the Governor have an argument about guaranteeing Grieg safety at the party which is about to start at the Winter Palace  Donald  Kresh robot  invokes the First Law in refusing to permit the Governor to leave the room until Kresh temporizes by activating the security robot detail in the Winter Palace  Meanwhile  a rustbacker  Norlan Fiyle  is caught by a Ranger on patrol  and agrees to turn in another Ranger  a corrupt man named Emoch Huthwitz who has been taking bribes in exchange for tipping off the rustbacking network whenever a raid is about to start  Caliban and Prospero  invited to the Governor gathering at the behest of Dr  Fredda Leving  are present just as Tonya Welton  leader of the Settlers  gets into a fight with two supposed Ironheads  members of a fringe political group led by Simcor Beddle  which calls for the removal of all Settlers from Inferno and for the government to rescind the law drafting robotic labor for terraforming  It is at this point that the action begins  After Grieg successfully carries off the gathering and demonstrates his political will while hobnobbing with all of the major players in Inferno complex politics  Sheriff Kresh is called to a murder scene involving the Ranger  Emoch Huthwitz  It is this unsettling event that makes Kresh wonder if the Governor was a target  and after realizing that he has been communicating with a simulated Governor (later found to be the result of a simulator device plugged into the communications console)  he rushes back to the Winter Palace and finds the Governor dead  in bed  Kresh rapidly takes unorthodox steps to allow himself to take charge of the investigation of the crime scene  He orders Sheriff Deputies sent over by high speed aircars  and calls in Dr  Leving to quietly examine the destroyed security robots on the scene  A man named Tierlaw Verick is swooped up after having evaded the initial searches by the deputies  Shortly after  Grieg death is announced to the world of Inferno  and Caliban goes into hiding along with Prospero  Meanwhile  a Spacer import/export broker  Sero Phrost  meets with Simcor Beddle and blackmails him by pointing out where some of the Ironhead money has been coming from  Settler Demand Notes have been funnelled from Phrost illegal sales of Settler hardware (partly subsidized by the Settler faction on Inferno) over to the Ironheads  Sheriff Kresh is informed some time later that Governor Chanto Grieg had foreseen the possibility he might be assassinated  and took steps to secure the office of Governor from being assumed by an ineffectual politician  Shelabas Quellam  The bombshell dropped on Kresh is that Grieg has named him as the Governor Designate  Governor Kresh takes the inaugural oath and pledges to pursue the killers of Chanto Grieg  and to run in a special election a hundred days from the date of his oath taking  After revelations that rustbacking connections seem to be coming from all corners of the case  Kresh realizes that Tierlaw Verick hired the killer  Ottley Bissal  in order to secure rustbacking profits because Grieg was going to let the New Law robots go free and decide of their own accord whether to stay on Purgatory  fr:Inferno (roman),1,0,0,0,0
643,Isaac Asimov Utopia, Utopia takes place five years into the reign of Alvar Kresh as the governor of Inferno  who is now married to roboticist Fredda Leving  The re terraforming effort is doing fairly well  but many believe it is still doomed to failure  The plot centers around a plan created by an Infernal named Davlo Lentrall to use a comet  named comet Grieg after the old governor  to dig a channel creating a northern sea  Norlan Fiyle  who has been working as an intelligence broker  found out about this plan early and informed the Settlers  the Ironheads  and the New Law robots of the plan  The issue is complicated by the fact that the plan calls for the comet to land essentially on top of the new law robot city of Valhalla  Tonya Welton  the leader of the settlers on Inferno  is upset by this plan having seen similar plans fail in the past  She orders her security people to grab Davlo and destroy his work  Although they were successful in destroying his data  the attempt to capture Davlo himself failed due to quick thinking on the part of Commander Justen Devray  now the head of the Combined Inferno Police  and the help of Davlo robot Kaelor  Unfortunately  the location of comet Grieg is lost  Davlo and Fredda Leving attempt to extract this information from Kaelor memory  but he ends up killing himself rather than release the information which might cause harm to humans  Davlo guilt over the death of his robot eventually leads him to oppose the comet plan all together  Eventually the information is retrieved when Jadelo Gildern  who had previously stolen the data from Davlo office  provides Governor Kresh with the missing data  While trying to decide whether to implement the comet plan  Kresh pays a visit to the terraforming control system  The system consists of a robotic unit  called Unit Dee  working with a non sentient Settler unit  Unit Dum  they are collectively referred to as the Twins  We learn that in order to avoid First Law conflicts  Unit Dee is being lied to and told that the entire terraforming project is really an elaborate simulation and that no actual human beings are involved  Significant care must be taken to ensure that Dee does not learn the truth  Dee confirmats that Davlo plan  if successful  stands a good chance of repairing Inferno ecology  The comet project is given the go ahead and work commences to evacuate the areas near the impact site  As the impact approaches  Simcor Beddle and Jadelo Gildern develop a plan to use a burrowing bomb  normally used for geological surveys  to destroy Valhalla before the new law robots have time to finish evacuating  On the way there though  Simcor aircar is attacked  his robots killed  and a demand  to stop the comet and deliver money into a bank account or Beddle will die  is written on the door  Kresh robot Donald  who heard of this incident  is forced by the First Law to act  He contacts robots in the area  who begin performing a search  and tells Dee that she is being lied to about the simulation  This causes Dee to shut down  leaving the people on the ground with few options for the final steering of the comet  Meanwhile  Devray tries to find Beddle  He tries putting money in the account mentioned in the demand and finds that it is automatically transferred to one of Gildern accounts  Devray brings in Gildern  and also questions Fiyle  from whom he learns about Beddle plan to destroy the New Law robots  Caliban turns himself in preemptively  The three talk while in jail  and Caliban manages to deduce what has happened to Beddle and rushes off to save him  While flying there  Caliban sends out a hyperwave message to tell the other robots that are searching to go back and that the situation is under control  Caliban goes to Valhalla  where he finds several New Law robots dead and Prospero holding Beddle prisoner  with a setup where if Beddle tries to leave  he will set off the bomb  Prospero was attempting to kill Beddle while avoiding the New First Law  Caliban is left with a choice of whom to let live  and kills Prospero  saving Beddle shortly before the comet hits  In the meantime  Dee finally wakes up and asks to talk to Kresh  She verifies that she was in fact being lied to  She asks Kresh if he believes Caliban message about saving Beddle  When Kresh says that he does believe it  Dee decides that she can manage the comet without First Law conflict  fr:Utopia (roman),1,0,0,0,0

646,The Glass Bead Game,The Glass Bead Game takes place at an unspecified date  centuries into the future  Hesse suggested that he imagined the book narrator writing around the start of the 25th century  The setting is a fictional province of central Europe called Castalia  reserved by political decision for the life of the mind; technology and economic life are kept to a strict minimum  Castalia is home to an austere order of intellectuals with a twofold mission: to run boarding schools for boys  and to nurture and play the Glass Bead Game  whose exact nature remains elusive and whose devotees occupy a special school within Castalia known as Waldzell  The rules of the game are only alluded to  and are so sophisticated that they are not easy to imagine  Playing the game well requires years of hard study of music  mathematics  and cultural history  Essentially the game is an abstract synthesis of all arts and sciences  It proceeds by players making deep connections between seemingly unrelated topics  The novel is an example of a bildungsroman  following the life of a distinguished member of the Castalian Order  Joseph Knecht  whose surname translates as servant but can also mean squire  The plotline chronicles Knecht education as a youth  his decision to join the order  his mastery of the Game  and his advancement in the order hierarchy to eventually become Magister Ludi  the executive officer of the Castalian Order game administrators  The beginning of the novel introduces the Music Master  the resident of Castalia who recruits Knecht as a young student and who is to have the most long lasting and profound effect on Knecht throughout his life  At one point  Knecht obliquely refers to the Music Master sainthood as the Master nears death in his home at Monteport  As a student  another meaningful friendship develops with Plinio Designori  a student from a politically influential family who is studying in Castalia as a guest  Knecht develops many of his personal views about what larger good Castalia can achieve through vigorous debates with Designori  who views Castalia as an ivory tower with little to no impact on the outside world  Although educated within Castalia  Knecht path to Magister Ludi is atypical for the order  as he spends a significant portion of his time after graduation outside the boundaries of the province  His first such venture  to the Bamboo Grove  results in his learning Chinese and becoming something of a disciple to Elder Brother  a recluse who had given up living within Castalia  Next  as part of an assignment to foster goodwill between the order and the Catholic Church  Knecht is sent on several missions to the Benedictine monastery of Mariafels  where he befriends the historian Father Jacobus   a relationship which also has profound personal impact for Knecht  As the novel progresses  Knecht begins to question his loyalty to the order; he gradually comes to doubt that the intellectually gifted have a right to withdraw from life big problems  Knecht comes to see Castalia as a kind of ivory tower  an ethereal protected community  devoted to pure intellectual pursuits but oblivious to the problems posed by life outside its borders  This conclusion precipitates a personal crisis  and  according to his personal views regarding spiritual awakening  Knecht does the unthinkable: he resigns as Magister Ludi and asks to leave the order  ostensibly to become of value and service to the larger culture  The heads of the order deny his request to leave  but Knecht departs Castalia anyway  initially taking a job as a tutor to his childhood friend Designori energetic and strong willed son  Tito  Only a few days later  the story ends abruptly with Knecht drowning in a mountain lake while attempting to follow Tito on a swim for which Knecht was unfit  The fictional narrator leaves off before the final sections of the book  remarking that the end of the story is beyond the scope of his biography  The concluding chapter  entitled The Legend  is reportedly from a different biography  After this final chapter  several of Knecht posthumous works are then presented  The first section contains Knecht poetry from various periods of his life  followed by three short stories labeled Three Lives  The stories are presented as exercises by Knecht imagining his life had he been born in another time and place  The first story tells of a pagan rainmaker named Knecht who lived many thousands of years ago  when women ruled  Eventually the shaman powers to summon rain fail  and he offers himself as a sacrifice for the good of the tribe  The second story is of Josephus  an early Christian hermit who acquires a reputation for piety but is inwardly troubled by self loathing and seeks a confessor  only to find that same penitent had been seeking him  The final story concerns the life of Dasa  a prince wrongfully usurped by his half brother as heir to a kingdom and disguised as a cowherd to save his life  While working with the herdsmen as a young boy  Dasa encounters a yogi in meditation in the forest  He wishes to experience the same tranquility as the yogi  but he is unable to stay  He later leaves the herdsmen and marries a beautiful young woman  only to be cuckolded by his half brother (now the Rajah)  In a cold fury  he kills his half brother and finds himself once again in the forest with the old yogi  who  through an experience of an alternate life  guides him on the spiritual path and out of the world of illusion (Maya)  The four lives  including that as Magister Ludi  oscillate between extroversion (and getting married: rainmaker  Indian life) and introversion (father confessor  Magister Ludi) while developing the four basic psychic functions of Analytical Psychology: sensation (rainmaker)  intuition (Indian life)  feeling (father confessor)  and thinking (Magister Ludi)  Originally  Hesse intended several different lives of the same person as he is reincarnated  Instead  he focused on a story set in the future and placed the three shorter stories  authored by Knecht in The Glass Bead Game at the end of the novel ,1,0,0,0,0
647,Seven Days in New Crete,The novel takes place in a future society (first established on the island of Crete  but later spreading through much of the world) in which most post medieval technology has been rejected  and a Triple Goddess religion is followed  The book is narrated by a mid 20th century poet  Edward Venn Thomas  who is transported forward in time by the New Cretans  Society is organized into five estates or social groups: captains  recorders (scribes)  commons (by far the most numerous)  servants  and magicians or poets (the least numerous)  which are analogized to the five fingers of a hand  Different villages practice different marriage customs (strict monogamy  non strict monogamy  or polyandry)  worship different local godlings  and specialize in various local handcrafts and foodstuffs  but share the common values of the New Cretan civilization and devotion to the Triple Goddess  Some of the social customs are somewhat matriarchal  There is no poverty in New Crete (money has been abolished) and little dissatisfaction  War is only known in the form of controlled local one day conflicts between neighboring villages  similar to the old game of village football or Shrovetide football  The poets or magicians of New Crete are an integral part of a religion centred on a sometimes capricious Goddess worshipped in three aspects: the maiden archer Nimu√´  the goddess of motherhood and sexuality Mari  and the hag goddess of wisdom Ana  (The names of the last two are similar to those of the Virgin Mary and her mother Saint Anne in Christianity ) The only masculine elements of New Cretan religion are the rival twin demi gods (the star god of the first half of the year and the serpent god of the second half of the year) who compete for the Goddess favor  and the local village godlings  who are all far below the Goddess as Queen of Heaven  However  the failings of past fallen civilizations are remembered and personified as an anti trinity of evil gods (the three Rogues): Dobeis  god of money and greed; Pill  god of theft and violence; and Machna  god of science and soulless machinery  Though Venn Thomas has been moved in time  he is still in the same area of southern France where he lived before and after World War II  and he compares the conditions in his own time to those under the New Cretan civilization (mostly to the disfavor of the 20th century  though some things seem too good to be true)  In this apparently idyllic utopian setting  Venn Thomas begins to realise that he has been chosen by the Goddess in order to inject disruption into a society that is becoming static and in danger of losing its vitality  A symptom of trouble is that over the course of the week described in the novel  the five poet magicians of the Magic House of the village of Horned Lamb all die or lose their status as members of the poet magician estate  In the last section of the book  Venn Thomas makes a trip to Dunrena  the town which is the capital of the local kingdom  in order to witness the half yearly ceremony of the changing of the king  carried out as a solemn religious theatrical performance culminating in a ritual sacrifice similar to those described in The Golden Bough  At the end of the book  Venn Thomas unleashes the whirlwind which will prepare the way for the transition to the next phase of history  and Sapphire (a young woman for whom he has had unsettled feelings) returns with him through time to be reborn as his daughter ,1,0,0,0,0

There are in fact no fewer than THREE apparently impossible vanishings by the assailant  each with a different  quite ingenious  explanation  The first  the only one which occurs in the classic locked room  turns out not to be a true disappearance at all  because  as Rouletabille deduces in a dazzling display of inexorable logic  the assailant was never in the room when it was actually locked  no matter how certain it seemed that he was  In a complicated sequence of events  the attack actually occurred many hours earlier than supposed  around 6 PM‚Äîbut the audible gunshot and the cry of Help  murder!!!  which happened after midnight in the locked room  were merely the acting out of a nightmare by Miss Stangerson  as she relived the earlier attack  Her severe injuries were inflicted not by the attacker but by Miss Stangerson herself  stumbling over furniture still overturned from the attack and violently striking her head ,0,1,0,0,0

655,2061: Odyssey Three,In the previous novel  2010: Odyssey Two  Jupiter was converted into a mini sun which was dubbed Lucifer following the Soviet ship Leonov‚Äôs mission to Jupiter to find out what happened to the Discovery  A message was sent to Earth by Dave Bowman  through HAL: This is due to Lucifer melting the frozen ocean beneath the surface of Europa  causing an atmosphere to form and leading to the discovery of alien life in Europa ocean  When the Leonov returned to Earth  Heywood Floyd (whose marriage had broken up while he was on the Leonov) suffered an accident  His recovery on an orbital space hospital took longer than expected and he became a permanent resident there after finding that his body could no longer handle Earth level gravity  His grandson Chris works aboard the spacecraft Galaxy and has not seen his grandfather in years  The black population of South Africa has rebelled in the 2030s and formed the United States of Southern Africa (USSA)  The white population fled to Europe  taking most of the country wealth with them and leaving the black population to rebuild the economy  which they did in a matter of weeks by use of diamonds  (2061 was published in 1987  at which time apartheid was still in force in South Africa ) Large scale interplanetary travel is now commercially viable with muon catalyzed fusion powered spacecraft  On Europa  an enormous mountain has sprung up out of nowhere  No one is sure of the origin of Mount Zeus; being asymmetrical  it cannot be a volcano  In 2061  at the age of 103  Floyd is chosen as one of several celebrity guests to come aboard the privately owned spaceliner Universe for the first ever human landing on the surface of Halley Comet  when it makes its periodic pass through the Solar System  Meanwhile  a team of scientists on Ganymede (formerly a moon of Jupiter that now orbits the star called Lucifer) is terraforming it for potential habitation  Scientist Rolf van der Berg  a second generation Afrikaner refugee  studies pictures of Mount Zeus and determines that it is in fact one enormous diamond  He communicates his discovery to his uncle Paul Kreuger; the expedition planners invite van der Berg to join the crew of Galaxy for its flyby of Europa  As Galaxy nears Europa  a stewardess attempts to single handedly hijack Galaxy  forcing it to crash into Europa ocean  Her plan having failed (her motivation and loyalties are not explained  but she is assumed to be a militant anti Afrikaner)  she commits suicide  The crew is now stranded  but their sister ship Universe is tasked to rescue her  Van der Berg and Chris Floyd take the shuttle William Tsung (nicknamed Bill Tee) to study Mount Zeus; also the wreck of the Chinese spacecraft Tsien  and the enormous monolith lying on its side at the border between the dayside and nightside  dubbed the Great Wall  Near Mount Zeus  van der Berg relays the message LUCY IS HERE to his uncle Paul  verifying that Mount Zeus is indeed one large diamond  The code word Lucy was chosen both in reference to the mini sun Lucifer and to an article in the journal Nature in 1981 hypothesizing that the cores of Uranus and Neptune were in fact diamonds the size of Earth (caused by the compression of carbon)  with the hypothesis making a logical extension to Jupiter  The article was subtitled Diamonds in the Sky  in reference to the Beatles song Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds  Mount Zeus is a fragment of Jupiter core which survived the creation of Lucifer and later struck Europa  On the Universe  the celebrity guests discuss the mystery surrounding Bowman and the monoliths  and whether they would be allowed to land on Europa to rescue Galaxy‚Äôs crew  Floyd follows a suggestion that he simply try to call Bowman on the radio  and that night has a strange dream in which he sees the monolith floating at the foot of his bed  The Bill Tee flies by Tsien  which has been completely stripped of its metals (rare and thus valuable to the Europans)  and on to the Great Wall  An image of his grandfather appears to Chris in the same way that Bowman appeared to Floyd in 2010  telling him that the Universe was coming  Universe rescues Galaxys crew; they are brought to Ganymede  where they watch as Mount Zeus  which has been steadily sinking  finally disappears beneath the Europan surface  Kreuger writes a follow up article for Nature  stating that Mount Zeus was a mere fragment of Jupiter core and it is almost certain that many more such large pieces of diamond are currently in orbit around Lucifer  and proposing that a program be initiated immediately to collect these enormous quantities of diamond and put them to use  Floyd and Chris become close again  and both become friends with van der Berg  They talk about how Floyd called Bowman on the radio  and Chris asks if Bowman ever replied  Floyd almost tells his grandson about the monolith in his cabin  but does not after rationalizing that it was probably a dream  It was not a dream  The monolith duplicated Floyd consciousness; there are now two Heywood Floyds  one an immortal being who resides with Bowman and HAL inside the Great Wall  In the epilogue  the star Lucifer stops shining in 3001  and in Manhattan the monolith awakes (referring to the original monolith discovered on the moon in 1999  and which was taken to Manhattan as a monument in 2006)  It is also indicated that humans have found more quantities of diamond from the former Jupiter and used it to create space elevators and an orbital ring connecting them  as suggested by Kreuger  (This idea will later be a central concept in 3001: The Final Odyssey ),1,0,0,0,0
656,3001: The Final Odyssey,This novel begins with a brief prologue describing the aliens who created the black monoliths  They apparently evolved from primordial soup  and over the course of millions of years  turned into a space faring species  As they explored the Universe  they saw that few intelligent species ever successfully evolved  Therefore  they traveled the universe and catalyzed the evolution of intelligent species wherever they went  including Earth  by increasing the evolving species' odds of survival  Upon reaching Earth  they performed experiments on many species to encourage the development of intelligence  Then they left  leaving their black monoliths behind  After visiting the Earth  the extraterrestrials continued to evolve  eventually to the point where they found a way to impress themselves into the fabric of space and time  thus becoming noncorporeal beings  Meanwhile  back in the Solar system  the alien monoliths continued to watch over humanity  However  sometimes the monoliths were prone to degenerating and acting independently of their original programming  3001 follows the adventures of Frank Poole  the astronaut who was killed by the HAL 9000 computer in 2001: A Space Odyssey by tearing his spacesuit open and casting him on a trajectory into deep space  One thousand years later  Poole freeze dried body is discovered out in the Kuiper belt beyond the orbit of Neptune by a human spaceship  a comet collecting space tug named the Goliath  The advanced medical science and technology of that age is able to bring Poole back to life  Being freeze dried and then kept near absolute zero for the intervening centuries preserved Poole body and brain well enough for him to make a full recovery  Poole is next taken home to explore and learn about the Earth in the year 3001  a millennium after he left it  Some of its notable features include the BrainCap  a brain computer interface technology that connects a computer directly to the human brain  genetically engineered dinosaur servants  a space drive  and four gigantic space elevators spaced evenly around the Equator  Human beings have also colonized the Jovian moons Ganymede and Callisto  During the 26th century  the remains of an alien monolith has been found in the Olduvai Gorge in East Africa (the one that had that kickstarted human evolution)  TMA 1  the black monolith that had been found on the Moon in 1999  was brought to the Earth in 2006 and then erected in front of the United Nations Building in New York City  In the course of the novel  it is determined that following the events of 2010: Odyssey Two and 2061: Odyssey Three the Jovian monolith had sent a report back to its makers some 450 light years away  It is expected to receive its orders on how to deal with humanity after the 900 year round trip  Presumably  the monolith was empowered to obliterate the nascent biosphere of Jupiter  but it needed a higher authority approval to obliterate the technological civilization on Earth  There is considerable worry that the judgment  which was based on the monolith observations of humanity up to 2061  will be negative  The entire human race  then  may be in danger of being obliterated by the aliens  just as the Jovian life forms discovered by David Bowman were deliberately destroyed in the course of making Jupiter into a second sun so the Europans could evolve  Frank manages to conscript Bowman and HAL  who had fused into a new entity ‚Äî Halman ‚Äî and now reside in the monolith computational matrix  to infect the monolith with a computer virus retrieved from Pico vault  a special containment facility on the moon used to house various chemical  biological  and cybernetic weapons in an attempt to avert a potential apocalypse  Just as the humans feared  the monolith does indeed receive orders to exterminate humankind  and it begins to duplicate itself many hundreds of millions of times over  These millions of monoliths assemble themselves into two separate screens in front of the Sun to prevent all light and heat from reaching the Earth and its colonies  The intent is to shut down the entire terrestrial biosphere  However  Halman had already infected the monolith with the virus at the time it began duplicating itself  and fifteen minutes after the screens are formed  all the monoliths disintegrate  including TMA 0 and TMA 1  Halman manages to upload its combined personalities into a petabyte capacity holographic 3D storage medium and thus survives the disintegration of the monoliths  However  that medium is infected with the virus in the process and is subsequently sealed by human scientists in Pico Vault  where it will presumably be stored until such time as humans (or others) choose to disinfect and revive it  At the close of the story  Poole and the other humans land on Europa and attempt to start peaceful relations with the primitive native Europans  Apparently  the creators of the Monoliths   having long since evolved into a noncorporeal and godlike state of existence   had been watching humanity  They decide to grant the human race a reprieve  and that they will not determine humanity

657,Rama Revealed, The book picks up the story immediately after the end of The Garden of Rama  The book follows the story of Nicole Wakefield and her escape from imprisonment left at the cliffhanger of the previous book  As the human colony continues to degenerate with respect to living conditions and human rights  the members of Nicole family escape to the region nicknamed New York  where they used to live in Rama II and already then came into contact with the alien species known as Octospiders  The Octospiders were a simple species until a space faring species made contact with them and forever changed their society  Undergoing genetic enhancements  the Octospiders became biological wizards and were eventually able to form a utopia of sorts  Eventually  the human colony police come after Nicole family in New York and they flee to the octospider city  After the human colony leader starts bombing the octospider city under a made up pretext and the octospiders retaliate  the situation becomes dire enough that Rama controlling intelligence intervenes to end the conflict caused by the Humans aboard  by sending everybody into hibernation until the end of the journey  The Rama spacecraft rendezvous with another Node  an enormous tetrahedron near the star Tau Ceti  designed to research any intelligent life capable of spaceflight  The humans are divided into two groups based mainly on the degree of xenophobia they had exhibited during the journey  Both groups will stay at the Node for the rest of their lives to be studied; the xenophobes are segregated and never allowed to see another alien again  To the more adaptable group  the purpose of the universe is revealed by the Nodal intelligence ,1,0,0,0,0
658,At the Mountains of Madness,The story is told in first person perspective by the geologist William Dyer  a professor at Miskatonic University  He writes to disclose hitherto unknown and closely kept secrets in the hope that he can deter a planned and much publicized scientific expedition to Antarctica  On a previous expedition there  scholars from Miskatonic University led by Dyer discovered fantastic and horrific ruins and a dangerous secret beyond a range of mountains higher than the Himalayas  A smaller advance group led by Professor Lake discovered and crossed the mountains and found the remains of 14 ancient life forms  completely unknown to science and unidentifiable as either plants or animals  Six of the specimens are badly damaged and the others uncannily pristine  Their highly evolved features are problematic: their stratum location puts them at a point on the geologic time scale much too early for such features to have naturally evolved yet  When the main expedition loses contact with Lake party  Dyer and the rest of his colleagues travel to their last known location to investigate  Lake camp is devastated  and both the men and the dogs slaughtered  while a man named Gedney and another dog are unaccounted for  Near the camp they find six star shaped snow mounds  and one specimen buried under each  They discover that the better preserved life forms have vanished  and that some form of dissection experiment has been done on an unnamed man and a dog  Dyer elects to close off the area from which they took their samples  Dyer and a graduate student named Danforth fly an airplane over the mountains  which they soon realize are the outer wall of a huge  abandoned stone city of cubes and cones  utterly alien compared with any human architecture  Because of their resemblance to creatures of myth mentioned in the Necronomicon  the builders of this lost civilization are dubbed the Elder Things  By exploring these fantastic structures  the men are able to learn the history of the Elder Things by interpreting their magnificent hieroglyphic murals: The Elder Things first came to Earth shortly after the Moon was pulled loose from the planet and were the creators of life  They built their cities with the help of Shoggoths  biological entities created to perform any task  assume any form  and reflect any thought  As more buildings are explored  a fantastic vista opens of the history of races beyond the scope of man understanding  including the Elder Things' conflicts with the Star spawn of Cthulhu and the Mi go who arrived on Earth some time after the Elder Things themselves  The images also reflect a degradation in the order of this civilization  as the Shoggoths gain independence  As more resources are applied to maintaining order  the etchings become haphazard and primitive  The murals also allude to some unnamed evil in an even larger mountain range just past their city which even they fear greatly  Eventually  as Antarctica became uninhabitable even for the Elder Things  they migrated into a large  subterranean ocean  Dyer and Danforth eventually realize they are not alone in the city  The Elder Things missing from the advance party camp had somehow returned to life and  after slaughtering the explorers  returned to the city of their origin  Dyer and Danforth discover traces of the Elder Things' earlier exploration  as well as sledges containing the corpses of Gedney and the dog missing from the camp  As the two progress further into the city  they are ultimately drawn to a massive  ominous entrance which is the opening of a tunnel which they believe leads into the subterranean region described in the murals  Compulsively they are drawn in  finding further horrors: evidence of dead Elder Things killed in a brutal struggle  and blind six foot tall penguins wandering around placidly  apparently as livestock for the unknown forms of life which lurked inside the subterranean abyss  They are then confronted with an immense  ululating horror in the form of a black  bubbling mass  which after a brief glimpse they identify as a Shoggoth  Danforth and Dyer escape with their lives using luck and diversion  On the plane high above the plateau  Danforth looks back and sees something that causes him to lose his sanity  He refuses to tell anyone (even Dyer) what he saw  though it is implied that it has something to do with what lies beyond the larger mountain range that even the Elder Things feared  Professor Dyer concludes that the Elder Things and their civilization were eventually destroyed by the Shoggoths they created and that this entity has sustained itself on the enormous penguins since eons past  He begs the planners of the next proposed Antarctic expedition to stay away from things that should not be loosed on this Earth ,1,0,0,0,0

660,Footfall,The book depicts the arrival of members of an alien species called the Fithp that have traveled to our solar system from Alpha Centauri in a large spacecraft driven by a Bussard ramjet  The aliens are intent on taking over the Earth  Physically  the Fithp resemble man sized  quadrupedal elephants with multiple trunks  They possess more advanced technology than humans  but have developed none of it themselves  In the distant past on their planet  another species was dominant  with the Fithp existing as animals  perhaps even as pets  This predecessor species badly damaged the environment  rendering themselves and many other species extinct  but left behind their knowledge inscribed on large stone cubes (called Thuktunthp  plural of Thuktun in the Fithp language)  from which the Fithp have gained their technology  The study of Thuktun is the only science the Fithp possess  The Fithp are armed with a technology that is superior rather than incomprehensible: laser cannon  projectile rifles  controlled meteorite strikes to bombard surface targets  lightcraft surface to orbit shuttles the size of warships  etc  The geopolitics of the world in this novel are those of the Cold War  although the setting of the story is in the mid 1990s  This affects the plot  since in the world of Footfall  the United States S R  is still a major world superpower  and has a greater presence in space than the United States  At the time of the novel writing  this was an extrapolation of contemporary analysis  The Fithp are herd creatures  and fight wars differently from humans  Throughout their history  when two herds met  they would fight until it was evident which one was dominant over the other; then fighting ceased and the losers were incorporated into the winning herd  The Fithp expect their contact with humans to proceed along these lines  and are confused by human attempts at peaceful contact  Upon arrival  they immediately attack the Russian space station  where Russians and Americans wait to greet them  They proceed to destroy military sites and important infrastructure on Earth  A US Congressman and Russian cosmonauts are captured from the ruins of the space station  The novel human characters fall into two major groups  those on Earth and those who are taken aboard the Fithp spaceship as captives  Civilians are used to show the effects of the war on day to day life in the United States  while military and government personnel convey a more strategic overview of events  Science fiction writers are employed as technical advisers on alien technology and behavior; these characters are based on real writers  including Niven (Nat Reynolds)  Pournelle (Wade Curtis)  and Robert Anson Heinlein (Bob Anson)  Facing possible extinction due to the long term effects of biological weapons  a group of high ranking Fithp were selected by wager to escape to the stars  The Chtaptisk Fithp ('Traveling Herd') are divided between leepers' and paceborn'  as the ship is both a generation ship and a sleeper ship  The original leaders of the herd are subordinate to their descendants the spaceborn  who are well prepared to start a space based civilization  but are still dedicated to the generations old ideal of conquest  After their initial assault  the Fithp land ground forces in the center of the North American continent  primarily in and around Kansas  They defeat efforts by a National Guard detachment (and  somewhat later  three American armored divisions) to dislodge them by using orbital lasers and barrages of kinetic energy weapons  but a combined Russian and American nuclear attack wipes out their beachhead  The Fithp  who are familiar with nuclear weapons but prefer to use cleaner ones  are shocked by what they consider the barbarity of humans' willingness to foul their own garden with radioactivity  Human protagonists  however  are exultant with victory  It is during this initial invasion that more captives are taken  These also comprise a mixed bag of civilians including an elderly couple from the US Bible Belt as well as a young woman who was a high functioning mental patient at Menninger  They are put to work by the Fithp on board their mothership  who expect them to integrate themselves into the herd  The humans decide to cooperate until a chance for some serious sabotage presents itself  The Fithp respond to the defeat of their invasion by dropping a dinosaur killer  a large asteroid whose impact results in environmental damage on a global scale  in particular the almost total destruction of India  In the aftermath  the aliens invade Africa  where they enjoy more success  One result is the end of South African Apartheid  Simply  Whites and Blacks become equal under the rule of the Fithp  The United States secretly builds a large  heavily armed spacecraft propelled by nuclear bombs (a real concept commonly known as Project Orion)  While an earlier implementation of the idea was ruled out due to environmental reasons and the danger of radioactive contamination  in the desperate situation facing humanity such considerations are cast aside  The ship is named after the Biblical Archangel Michael  who cast Lucifer out of Heaven  The Michael launches and battles through small enemy digit ships in orbit  Though seriously damaged  she pursues the alien mothership  One of the space shuttles carried aboard Michael rams the Fithp ship  seriously damaging it  and slowing it down enough for the Michael to catch and attack it  dealing additional damage  On Earth  American President David Coffey receives an offer of conditional surrender from the Fithp  Coffey leans towards accepting the offer; he is willing to let the Fithp withdraw into space  and is reluctant to destroy their sophisticated technology and cargo of females and children  He is opposed by his advisors  who feel that by allowing the Fithp to escape and regroup  he risks the whole of humanity; pressing the attack risks its foes  When Coffey seemingly folds under the pressure of making a final decision  his hardliner National Security Adviser  Admiral Carrell effectively stages a bloodless coup d'etat  circumventing the President and communicating the rejection of the aliens' terms  A final act of sabotage by escaped humans aboard the alien vessel forces the Fithp to accept humanity as the stronger species and surrender themselves to become part of the human herd ,1,0,0,0,0
661,Shade Children, Gold Eye  a fifteen year old  was born near the time of the Change  He was physically affected by the Change radiation and his eyes  including his pupils  are a bright golden color  He is also unusual in that he managed to escape and elude the Trackers and Myrmidons for a time  Yet as the story begins  he is finally trapped by the Myrmidons  and prepares to kill himself to prevent his organs from being harvested  This turns out to be unnecessary as he is saved by a team of strangers who stun the Myrmidons with a flashbang grenade and lift him to safety  These strangers are a team of Shade Children  and after the group eludes some Ferrets by hiding in a tall building  he accompanies them back to the Submarine  Shade Children hideout  Gold Eye joins Shade Children  and is soon sent off on his first mission with the team that saved him: Ella  Ninde  and Drum  Each team member is unique  and has Change abilities that correspond somewhat to their personality  This mission is a critical one: to retrieve the equipment and data from Shade abandoned laboratory on the University campus in the Department of Abstract Computing  including a device that measures Change radiation  It is also one of the most dangerous missions: All of the teams who have previously attempted this retrieval have been killed or captured in the process  Ella team is successful  even when the Overlord Black Banner surrounds and invades the building  alerted by Leamington  a pre Change artificial intelligence who calls the police on detection of the intruders  Leamington is notably different from Shade in that he is an artificial intelligence as opposed to an uploaded consciousness  After resting at the Sub  Shade unveils the reward created with the recovered data: metal crowns called Deceptors which scramble the sensory input of the Overlords' creatures  effectively making a human wearer invisible and non olfactive to them as long as the power supply is maintained  It also is later revealed that scent trails are equally scrambled  although footprints are not  With this sudden new advantage and information  Shade is more curious about the method of distribution of Change radiation and sends Ella team on a newer  even more dangerous mission: to steal a Change Projector from Fort Robertson  the stronghold of the Overlord named Red Diamond  This mission is not successful: on entry  the team discovers that the stronghold stretches underground  allowing for the unforeseen presence of creatures  The team Deceptors run out prematurely as they discover a Myrmidon barracks  and they escape with a conch shaped Overlord device called a Thinker  but without Drum who  having been winded  stays behind to fight  It is presumed by the rest of the team that he is killed  On return to the Sub  however  Gold Eye has a vision in which he sees Drum being stored temporarily in the Meat Factory  indicating that Drum is still alive  The group presents the device to Shade  who appreciates the Overlord device Ninde took from Fort Robertson but refuses a request to rescue Drum  as the Meat Factory is one of the most heavily guarded Overlord facilities  The team  led by Ella  defies Shade orders and infiltrates the Meat Factory  successfully rescuing Drum  They then leave cautiously  using the Deceptors to mask their trail  While resting among the branches of a large tree  Ninde telepathically detects an Overlord  The detection proves not only to be hard mentally on her since the Overlord is of human or greater intelligence  but also emotionally hard: Ninde discovers that the Overlords are essentially human  Despite the difficulty  she discovers that the Overlord may know something about a mind in a machine  a dangerous thing for them  since Shade   a machine intelligence  is their leader and benefactor  They continue  to discover on reaching the Submarine that it has been invaded by an Overlord  Red Diamond  and that all of the people inside have been killed or captured  Fortunately  Shade had realized long before that the Sub was not a permanent base  and established multiple supply caches throughout the city in case a team was stranded in the field or the Sub was taken  True to their training  the team heads immediately to the nearest cache   to discover Shade  who escaped  apparently by chance  while testing a mobile robotic body for himself based around the Thinker  Shade escape is doubly fortuitous in that the Overlord used an electromagnetic pulse weapon to disable the Submarine; had he been within range of the weapon  he would have been incapacitated  Despite the loss of all of Shade Children except for Ella team  the meeting is a good one: Shade has discovered how to defeat the Overlords  Examining and measuring Change radiation  he had discovered that all known Change Projectors were actually redistributors of Change radiation from a single source  a so called Grand Projector  Were this projector destroyed  all creatures would cease to function  and the Overlords would likely be removed whence they came  Having discovered the source of the Change Radiation   a Mount Silverstone   they set out with Deceptors to find and destroy the source  which would hopefully bring reality back to normal  But soon the team is betrayed by Shade  who had made a deal with the Overlords  Desiring a body with which to survive the Overlords' destruction (since the Thinker is also a product of the Change)  he betrayed the children  bartering them and the knowledge of their Change talents in exchange for Overlord body technology (his Thinker is destroyed by an Overlord later)  Gold Eye and Ninde are taken prisoner  Ella and Drum  managing to escape  climb to the top of Mount Silverstone  meet a hologram of Shade  who though having been physically destroyed  is spread through the Overlords' computer systems  His original personality had been attempting to manifest itself  such as when Shade was speaking to Gold Eye and Ninde about their fate at the hands of the Overlords  or when Shade was inwardly arguing with himself  However  it only managed to when the Thinker was destroyed  He guides them to the Grand Projector  when  about to disable it  they hear an Overlord approaching  Ella  desperate  destroys the Thinker which regulates the Grand Projector  causing it to overload  This has the positive effect of disabling all Overlord creatures and removing the Overlords  but exposes Ella and Drum to lethal amounts of Change radiation  killing them  The burst of Change radiation  while not lethal where Ninde and Gold Eye are (they are being executed by an Overlord)  enables them to respectively read the minds of thousands of newly freed children  and see a distant future  at which time he and Ninde are the parents of two children named for Ella and Drum  Ninde sends this soon to be now to Ella and Drum through her Change Talent  and those thoughts are the last things that they see ,1,0,0,0,0

663,Inferno,Inferno is based upon the hell described in Dante Inferno  However  it adds a modern twist to the story  The story is told in the first person by Allen Carpentier (n√© Carpenter)  an agnostic science fiction writer who died in a failed attempt to entertain his fans at a Science fiction convention party  He is only released  after many decades  from a Djinn bottle in the Vestibule on the outer edge to Hell when he finally calls upon God for mercy  Upon release he is met by Benito  a Virgil like figure whose full identity is not immediately apparent  Benito offers to take him out of Hell by bringing him to the center  At first  as Allen and Benito travel through Hell  Allen tries to scientifically rationalize everything he sees  renaming his surroundings as 'Infernoland'  a high tech amusement park some thousand years in the future  It isn't until he sees a man recover from incineration and his own leg heal from a compound fracture that he starts to actually believe that he is in Hell  From this point on  as Allen travels through the inner circles of Hell  he sees how he is guilty of each of the sins in some fashion  commenting to himself that he is in no danger from ditch 3 of circle 8 (simony) only because he has never had any holy offices to sell  At first Allen views the punishments for these sins as far surpassing the crime  repeatedly thinking  We are in the hands of infinite power and infinite sadism  although he comes to more and more to accept the justice of the situation as he realizes that it is their continuing denial of their sins that keeps many of the condemned in hell  Eventually Allen takes over Benito role in helping reformed souls proceed onto Paradise via Purgatory  allowing Benito to move on towards Purgatory himself  It is revealed that Benito is actually Benito Mussolini  prime minister of Italy during World War II  Along the way Allen meets a number of his Californian acquaintances and notable people from history (e g  Epictetus  Billy the Kid  Jesse James  Bob Ford  L Ron Hubbard  Henry VIII of England  Vlad Tepes  Aimee Semple McPherson  William M  Tweed  Al Capone) and from classical mythology (e g  Hector  Aeneas  Charon  Minos  Phlegyas  Geryon)  Due to the long time he spent bottled up in the outer vestibule he also meets some people from the future of 1976  such as a space shuttle pilot ,1,0,0,0,0
664,The Owl Service, Roger and Alison are stepbrother and sister  Alison father died and her mother Margaret has married Clive  a businessman and former RAF officer  Clive former wife was notoriously unfaithful  bringing shame to the family and a particular kind of pain to his son  Roger  To bond the new family together they are spending a few weeks of the summer in an isolated valley in Wales  a few hours' drive from Aberystwyth  They occupy a fine house formerly owned by Alison father  subsequently transferred to her in order to avoid death duty  He in turn inherited it from a cousin  Bertram  who died there in mysterious circumstances around the time Alison was born  With the house comes Huw Halfbacon  also known as Hugh the Flitch  a handyman and gardener  He is the last of the original domestic staff to remain at the cottage  The former cook  Nancy  had left to live in Aberystwyth but is offered a substantial amount to come and resume her duties  With her comes her son Gwyn  He has never seen the valley before but knows everything about it  courtesy of his mother stories  Someone else who knows a lot about the place is Huw  but he is very mysterious about it  Oddly  Nancy has told Gwyn nothing about Huw  Alison hears scratching noises in the attic above her bed and persuades Gwyn to investigate  He finds stacks of dinner plates with a floral pattern  When he picks one up  something odd happens  He almost falls through the ceiling while simultaneously Roger  lounging by a large flat stone near the river  hears a scream and seems to see something flying through the air toward him  The stone is known as the Stone of Gronw  It has a hole neatly bored through it  and legend says that Lleu killed Gronw by throwing his spear clear through the stone that Gronw was holding to shield himself  Alison begins behaving peculiarly  She traces the pattern on the plate onto paper and folds the result to make an owl  Finding out that Gwyn has been in the attic  Nancy demands that Alison give up the plate  Alison asserts she has no right to it  and eventually produces a blank white plate  She maintains that the pattern disappeared from the plate  Alison becomes obsessed by the plates  One by one she traces them and makes the owls  and one by one the plates become blank  The owls themselves disappear  though no one cares at first about some folded paper models  In the house billiard room part of the wall has been covered with pebble dash  Bit by bit this begins to crack and fall away  exposing first a pair of painted eyes  and then an entire portrait of a woman made of flowers  Tensions between the occupants of the house began to rise  Gwyn is intelligent and wants to further his education  but Clive expresses a stereotypical clannish closed ranks attitudes of the upper middle class towards him  Roger begins to feel hostile despite his initial friendliness  Eventually he takes to ridiculing Gwyn efforts to improve himself with elocution lessons on gramophone records  calling them improve a prole  Alison seems friendly to Gwyn and the two go on long walks together  She has visions where she sees herself next to him  even though he is some distance away  Margaret  her mother  never appears but the need to keep her happy affects everyone else  As the vacation slides into disaster  the British attitude of seeing it through to the end prevails  even though Clive could pay off all the staff and leave at any time  Nancy repeatedly threatens to quit  and is repeatedly mollified with crisp banknotes  She constantly warns Gwyn to stay away from the others  lest he be taken out of school and forced to work in a grocery store to earn some money  Nancy gradually reveals her resentment of Margaret and Alison  as she once expected to marry Bertram and should have been mistress of the very house she toils in  Competition between the boys for Alison is  at most  a subtext here  although Garner television script is much more overt about Gwyn attraction to her  despite his poverty  Alison  notwithstanding any attraction to him  would rather keep her privileges  such as her tennis club membership  than cross her mother  This is something she eventually admits to Gwyn  The mysterious Huw presides over this like some ringmaster at a circus  making strange pronouncements  There is background of odd comments from the villagers  noises of motorcycles in the distance  sounds of birds  and mysterious noises from locked buildings  Gwyn follows Alison on one of her inexplicable midnight walks  She is completing her tracing of the plates somewhere in the woods  Gwyn is harassed by columns of flame  which he tries to convince himself are merely marsh gas  He finds Alison when she has made the final owl  then escorts her back to the cottage  Huw is waiting  and greets them with the remark She is come  By this time the connection between the legend and the events is becoming clear  Gwyn tries to see things rationally  He attempts to run away  walking up the sides of the valley as the weather worsens  but is chased back by a pack of sheepdogs  Stealing Roger hiking gear  he tries the other side of the valley  only to find Huw waiting for him  Huw tells him of the power that exists in the valley  how those of the blood have to re enact the legend each time  and how Blodeuwedd always comes as owls instead of flowers because of the hatred  Huw  of course  is Gwyn real father  so Gwyn is the next generation  Huw was responsible for Bertram death  sabotaging the antique motorcycle Bertram liked to ride around the garden  not realising he would take it out on the dangerous hill road  The dinner plates and the wall painting were done by Huw ancestors  trying to lock up the magic in their creations  but Alison has let it loose again  Huw directs Gwyn to a crack in an ancient tree where he finds various things  including a spear head  All the men of Huw line come to this tree  where they leave something and take something  Gwyn removes a carved stone  leaving a trashy owl decorated trinket  He tells Huw to give the stone to Alison  Gwyn is going to return to the cottage and leave with his mother  who has finally and irrevocably quit  In a locked room  Roger discovers a stuffed owl  which Bertram shot in his own attempt to lay the ghost of Blodeuwedd  along with all the paper owls that have traced intricate patterns in the dust of a storeroom  He also finds the sabotaged motorcycle  Nancy charges in and wrecks the place  destroying the owl and then attempting to knock the very feathers out of the air  Alison  having been given the stone by Huw  collapses and is brought into the kitchen  where she writhes in the grip of some force that makes claw marks on her skin  Huw begs Gwyn to comfort her  but Gwyn by now feels totally betrayed by Alison and can say nothing  A storm rages outside  branches smashing through the windows and skylight  a sound of owls and eagles pressing in on them  Feathers swirl in the room and trace owl patterns on the walls and ceiling  Roger is desperate  abasing himself before Gwyn  but to no avail  It is always owls  over and over and over  says Huw  Then Roger shouts that it is not true  that she is flowers  He yells this at Alison until abruptly all is peaceful  and the room is filled not with feathers but with petals

669,He  She and It,The main story of He  She and It is situated in North America in the near future of the year 2059  At that time  the economic and political power is held by few multis    huge multi national enterprises with their own social hierarchy that have produced an affluent society  The main part of the population  however  lives in the glop outside of the multis' enclaves within an environment that has mainly been destroyed  Here  the life is dominated by poverty  gangs and the law of the stronger man  An exception from this are the so called free towns that are able to sell their technologies to the multis but remain autonomous  Communication is handled via a network which allows the participants to project themselves into Cyberspace  When the protagonist Shira loses custody of her son Ari to her ex husband Josh  she returns from her multi Yakamura Stichen (Y S) to her hometown Tikva (Hope in Hebrew)   a Jewish freetown  There  she starts working on the socialization of the cyborg Yod (the tenth letter in Hebrew and a symbol for God in Kabbalah)  who has been created illegally by Avram to protect the city  Yod is the tenth cyborg (a robot with human appearance and programmed human characteristics) in a row of previously failed experiments whose programming has partially been completed by Malkah  Shira grandmother  While Shira and Yod build up a (sexual) relationship  Shira childhood sweetheart Gadi  Avram son  also comes back to Tikva  Gadi returns due to his banishment for sleeping with a young girl  When Malkah is working on a chimeara (security software) to protect the city from online attack  she is attacked by Y S  Yod  however  is able to prevent the attack  Eventually  Y S invites Shira to a new hearing concerning the custody of her son  Shira is accompanied by Yod  her mother Riva  and Nili  a biotechnologically enhanced woman from a nuclear devastated Palestine  when the situation escalates  The Y S delegation and Riva die in the fight  Thereupon Shira  Malkah and Yod decide to infiltrate the Y S network base  They manage to get hold of personnel files revealing a conspiracy against Shira and Tikva  As next step  Shira and Yod are accompanied by Nili and Gadi into the Glop  Here  they get in contact with an organized underground group in which they discover Riva still alive and participating in resistance activities  From the Glop they travel into the Y S enclave in Nebraska to kidnap Ari  There  Josh is killed by Yod  Back to Tikva  Shira family spends some quiet time until Y S invites them to a further meeting in the net  Y S demands that Yod be handed over  for Y S to acquire its technology  Avram agrees to the deal with the hope of creating another cyborg  So  Yod agrees to destroy him/itself when sent to the enclave  However  Yod made sure that his own explosion would cause a synchronous explosion in Avram lab  As Avram dies in this accident and all his notes are destroyed the creation of a further cyborg becomes impossible  Finally  Malkah leaves Tikva with Nili to visit to a secret town in post nuclear holocaust Israel and to profit from the possible biotechnological enhancements  Shira is integrated into Tikva society further  When she discovers copies of the notes concerning Yod  she initially plans on recreating Yod; ultimately she respects Yod wishes and destroys them  The main plot is interwoven with a story Malkah tells Yod that deals with Rabbi Judah Loew who Malkah depicts as her ancestor living in the ghetto of Prague around 1600  To protect the Jewish community from the Christian mob  Loew uses the knowledge of Kabbalah to create the golem Joseph from clay  His granddaughter Chava  a very educated woman  teaches Joseph to read and to write  Joseph successfully protects the ghetto and begins to think of himself as human and makes a plea for his right to a human existence  However  when the pogrom climate calms down  Loew returns Joseph to clay  The two stories are mutually illuminating  both asking what it means to be human both from the perspective of the man made life and that of those who love the artificial lives ,1,0,0,0,0
670,The Light of Other Days, The wormhole technology is first used to send digital information via gamma rays  then developed further to transmit light waves  The media corporation who develops this advance can spy on anyone anywhere it chooses  A logical development from the laws of space time allows light waves to be detected from the past  This enhances the wormhole technology into a time viewer where anyone opening a wormhole can view people and events from any point throughout time and space  When the technology is released to the general public  it effectively destroys all secrecy and privacy  The novel examines the philosophical issues that arise from the world population (increasingly suffering from ecological and political disturbances) being aware that they could be under constant observation by anyone  or that they could observe anyone without their knowledge  Anyone is able to observe the true past events of their families and their heroes  An underground forms which attempts to escape this observation; corruption and crime are drastically reduced; nations discover the true causes and outcomes of international conflicts; and religions worldwide are forced to reevaluate their divine histories  As the underground movement grows  it utilizes a direct neural interface coupled with the unlimited communication provided by the wormhole technology to develop a group mind  One of the central themes of the novel is that history is biased towards viewpoints of the person who wrote it  Hence many great historical events often did not occur as they now are collectively remembered  For example  during the book progression the time viewer technology shows that Jesus was the illegitimate son of a Roman centurion (although the apocryphal story of his visiting Great Britain was proven to be true)  and that Moses was based on a collection of stories rather than the actions of a real person  In a climactic time viewing experiment at the end of the novel  a time hole is opened to the beginning of life on Earth and it is discovered that all existing life is descended from a biological sample placed by intelligent beings (labeled Sisyphans) who inhabited the Earth over three billion years ago  trying to preserve genetic samples when geological and climatic changes and a large Bolide threatened an extinction level event ,1,0,0,0,0

instead of dissolving with the other ghosts  they and other ghosts decide to remain temporarily intact in order to join Lord Asriel army to fight the Spectres  wraith like creatures that devour adult souls in various worlds  reasoning that the Spectres attack daemons which they no longer possess  Mrs  Coulter enters the Clouded Mountain  citadel of the Authority  where she meets Regent Metatron  She offers to betray Asriel  letting Metatron think he will be able to kill him and get Lyra  but her ultimate hope is that he will destroy himself in the process  When she leads Metatron to Asriel  Mrs  Coulter is able to confess her scheme to him  and they unite to save Lyra and attack Metatron  All three fall into an Abyss between the worlds and cease to exist  Ironically  the Authority dies of his own frailty when Will and Lyra unknowingly free him from the crystal prison where Metatron trapped him;

679,Oryx and Crake, The novel begins after the collapse of civilization by an event that is not immediately identified  The protagonist is Snowman  a post apocalyptic hermit character  He resides near a group of what he refers to as Crakers‚Äîstrange human like creatures  They bring Snowman food and consult him on matters that surpass their understanding  In addition  strange hybrid beasts such as wolvogs  pigoons and rakunks roam freely  As the story develops  these assorted lifeforms are revealed to be the products of genetic engineering  In flashbacks  we learn that Snowman was once a young boy named Jimmy  who grew up in the near  yet undefined past  His world was dominated by multinational corporations which kept their employees' families in privileged compounds separated from a global lower moiety of pleeblands  Shortly after Jimmy family moved to the HelthWyzer corporate compound (where his father worked as a genographer) Jimmy met and befriended Glenn (referred to throughout the novel as Crake)  a brilliant science student  Jimmy and Crake spend a lot of their leisure time playing online computer games such as Kwiktime Osama (a reference to Osama bin Laden) and Blood and Roses  smoking skunkweed  or watching live executions  Noodie News  frog squashing  graphic surgery and child pornography  One of Crake favourite pastimes is an online game called Extinctathon  a trivia game which requires immense knowledge of extinct animal and plant species  Using the codenames Thickney (Jimmy) and Crake (Glenn)  they both play as teenagers  It is not until they are both in university that Jimmy discovers that Crake has advanced through the game to become a Grandmaster of Extinctathon  On another trip through the dark underbelly of the Web  they come across an Asian child pornography website  where Jimmy is struck and haunted by the eyes of a young girl  The two male characters pursue different educational paths: Crake attends the highly respected Watson Crick Institute where he studies advanced bioengineering  but Jimmy ends up at the loathed Martha Graham Academy  where students study literature and the humanities  which are not valued fields of study except for their commercial and/or propaganda applications  After finishing school  Jimmy ends up writing ad copy  while Crake becomes a bioengineer  Crake uses his prominent position at the biotechnology corporation to launch a project to create the Crakers  His goal is to create a peaceful society where people will live harmoniously with each other and nature  These genetically engineered humans are leaf and grass eating herbivores who only have sexual intercourse during limited breeding seasons when they are polyandrous  Crake eventually finds the girl from the child pornography website (or a woman who could be her) and hires her  as both a prostitute for himself  and a teacher for the Crakers  She takes the pseudonym Oryx  derived from the entry for Oryx beisa in Extinctathon  Jimmy identifies the haunting memory of the young girl with Oryx  though it is never made clear whether or not the two are the same person  Oryx eventually becomes intimately involved in the lives of Jimmy and Crake  and both fall in love with her  Oryx  however  views their relationship as strictly professional and only admires Crake as a scientist and great man  For fun and affection she turns to Jimmy  though her feelings for him are not as clear  The two hide their relationship from Crake  and Jimmy is often plagued with the thought of Crake finding out about his betrayal  At the same time  Crake creates a virulent genetic pandemic disguised as a prophylactic agent that  apparently  killed off most humans except for Jimmy  Jimmy was unknowingly vaccinated by Crake with the intention of acting as a guardian for the Crakers  Crake rationale is that he is heroically saving intelligent life from an inevitably dying society  In the story climax  Crake perfected hot bioform  present in one of his company products  is activated and spreads throughout the world  During the chaos  Crake presents himself to Jimmy  then kills Oryx by slitting her throat

and reminded of his promise to her to watch over them  Snowman instills the Crakers with his own invented religion revolving around Crake and Oryx  Oryx becomes the guardian of the animals and Crake

689,Thief of Time, The Auditors are upset because the human race (although this appears to include all races on the Discworld  not just the humans) are living their lives in   what the Auditors consider to be   an unpredictable (and therefore not understandable) way  To fix this matter once and for all  they decide to convince a young clock maker  Jeremy Clockson  in Ankh Morpork to build a perfect glass clock  They do not reveal that this will imprison Time (the anthropomorphic personification) and thereby freeze time (the physical quantity) on the Discworld  By freezing time  the Auditors intend to eliminate the unpredictability that humans cause through their everyday actions (and have enough time  for once  to file all the paperwork)  Death discovers their plans  but is unable to act directly because of previous agreements with the Auditors  Instead  Death sends his granddaughter Susan to stop them  assisted (apparently) by the Death of Rats and Quoth the Raven  Meanwhile  in a distant valley  a young apprentice of the History Monks  Lobsang Ludd  is apprenticed to Lu Tze  known throughout the Oi Dong Monastery as 'The Sweeper'  Following a highly impressive patch up job with time (the physical quantity) by Lobsang  he and Lu Tze are brought before the Abbot  where they hear that a glass clock is being built  Lu Tze knows of such a clock side effects  since he was sent to prevent a previous clock from being built in √úberwald  However  due to the difficulties inherent in √úberwald (including the difficulty in determining which specific bolt of lightning hitting which castle might start the glass clock) he failed to stop the original   but Time only froze for a moment before a metal spring snapped and caused the clock to shatter  Having figured out that the new glass clock would be likely built in Ankh Morpork  Lu Tze and Lobsang head for the city to try to stop Jeremy from building it  The Auditors end up using one of their own as an agent when contacting Jeremy  Myria LeJean takes a human form and becomes quite disturbed by her experiences as she becomes more human and individual  as opposed to the collective Auditors  As she begins to understand more about humans  she opposes the activation of the clock and finds ways to delay its creation  This annoys the other Auditors who create human bodies of their own and   naming themselves after colours (in a possible play on the secret identities in Reservoir Dogs)   they prevent Myria from smashing the clock with a hammer  and organise a localised storm  a bolt of lightning hits Jeremy Clockson workshop and the clock is started  Lobsang Ludd is just smashing his way through the window of the workshop at the moment the clock starts  having been delayed when he went back to help Lu Tze  but he is too late to stop it‚Ä¶ However  Lobsang is able to continue moving  He meets Susan Sto Helit (whose own attempts to stop the clock being started were less successful) and finds out after his time storer stops spinning  that  as a creature not limited by time  he was not affected by the starting of the glass clock  Meeting up with Myria LeJean  they work to correct the problem and fight the Auditors  Since Myria is no longer part of the Collective hive mind of the Auditors  Susan suggests she change her name to Unity   which she likes  Susan and the newly named Unity discover that Lobsang Ludd and Jeremy Clockson seem to share an astonishing mental connection  When Lobsang speaks  Jeremy (who was knocked unconscious by the lightning that started the clock and whose body was moved away from the Auditors by Myria/Unity) attempts to form the same words  despite his comatose state  Susan is able to shed light on this when she reveals that she met the midwife who brought Lobsang and Jeremy into the world   none other than the best midwife in the world   Nanny Ogg  Nanny has told her that she delivered two boys an instant apart and Susan realises that both Lobsang and Jeremy are the same person  Lobsang and Jeremy become infused  although they are nothing more than blue mist to begin with  Susan continues to call the mist Lobsang  since she is told that Lobsang had the better memories  Using chocolate  Susan  Unity and a re animated Lu Tze kill a number of Auditors (the taste sensation of chocolate literally blows them away) and Lobsang is able to destroy the clock  freeing Time and unfreezing time  He then meets with his mother  Time  and his father  Wen the Eternally Surprised (the first Abbot of Oi Dong monastery) before effectively taking over Time job  He attempts to learn Lu Tze fifth surprise (an ongoing theme in the novel as the sweeper refuses to tell him)  after which he is defeated in the iron dojo by Lu Tze  but passes his training anyway and becomes a sweeper  He asks Lu Tze advice about Susan and he returns to Ankh Morpork  where the two have an unspecified perfect moment  Throughout the story  Death is trying to round up the other Horsemen of the Apocalypse  War  Famine and Pestilence  none of whom want to join up (compare with Sourcery when the Four Horsemen of the Apocralypse ride out  but having stopped off at the pub three of them have their Horses stolen)  The Fifth Horseman   Ronnie Soak (originally called Kaos   Soak spelled backwards   as in Chaos) who left before they became famous   agrees to join Death in the fight against the Auditors  and the other three also arrive as the battle prepares to start  Kaos is useful due to his sword of chaos  which goes against the rules and though flaming  is used to keep his milk cool  An Angel with an Iron book appears during the battle  It is not explained who won the fight  but since Death (at least) appears in books set chronologically later it can only be assumed that the Horsemen triumphed ,1,0,0,0,0
690,Code of the Lifemaker,About 1 000 000 B C   an unidentified alien race sent out robotic factories to many worlds in their part of the galaxy to prepare for future settlement  One of those factory ships suffers severe radiation damage from a near miss by a supernova and goes off course  drifting in space for a hundred thousand years before landing on the Saturnian moon Titan  Due to a malfunction in its database it begins producing imperfect copies that begin to evolve on their own  (The description of this background is presented in a prologue that proved sufficiently popular among readers that it was later anthologized on its own in a collection of Hogan short fiction ) The resulting machine ecosystem eventually gives rise to humanoid robots with human like intellects who develop a civilization similar to early civilization of Earth  Almost all of them have reverence for their mythical creator  a being they call the Lifemaker  Early in the 21st century  the North Atlantic Space Organization (combining NASA and NATO) dispatched the Orion with a cover story of terraforming Mars for human habitation  Karl Zambendorf  a con artist who is present on this expedition to verify ESP over interplanetary distances  prematurely learns that the Orion and its crew of researchers is headed for Titan  where the discovery of the Taloids has been kept need to know on Earth  When the Orion arrives  the first landing party sets down in a freethinking state where Thirg  a Taloid who was cast out of his home state Kroaxia  has fled  They are mistaken for the Lifemaker because they have come from the sky  which the Taloids cannot see out of due to Titan atmosphere  But Thirg becomes more discerning as he and the humans begin to understand more of each others' speech  Thirg brother Groork has come from Kroaxia to apprehend him  but Zambendorf intercepts him and sends him back to Kroaxia as a prophet  Zambendorf learned that NASO plans to exploit Titan natural resources and use the Taloids to build the factories they need  reducing them to slaves  The NASO business administrators on the Orion are already in agreement with the Kroaxian government to use human (the Taloids call humans Lumians because they glow brightly in their infrared vision) weapons to conquer Titan  believing the Kroaxian leadership buttressed by priests will be the easiest to control  Zambendorf  in his unanticipated role as Messenger for the Lifemaker  has given Groork guidelines akin to the Ten Commandments for his people to prevent a war from starting  All Taloids are brothers and No Taloid is to enslave or be a slave does not sit well with the ruling establishment of Kroaxia  and Groork is saved by the Orion crew not working for NASO  There will be use of Titan resources  but the partnership between humans and Taloids will be one of equals ,1,0,0,0,0

he tells Waldo  He shows Waldo some tricks he can do now that he understands magic  He sticks a penknife through his hand and withdraws it without any bleeding  which Waldo finds unimpressive  Hysterical vascular control  a perfect clinical case  he thinks  Then Rambeau places the knife on the palm of his hand and turns the hand palm down  the knife staying in place  To Waldo  with his firm footing in the physical sciences  this is either a trick or something truly impossible  He calls Stevens to have Rambeau brought to him  but Stevens reports that Rambeau somehow escaped from his restraints without actually unfastening them  Not only that  he has made another set of deKalbs behave as strangely as McLeod  Waldo is his usual self at first  calling Stevens incompetent  but then he seems to mellow  He thanks Stevens instead  and asks to have Rambeau notes and equipment shipped up to him  Seeing the eccentric deKalbs  Waldo realizes that he must learn what happened to them  Schneider will not leave his home  so Waldo has to go back to Earth  an experience he dreads  Shipped down in a medical craft  with Grimes in attendance  he lies in his waterbed while Schneider examines him  Schneider thinks he should get up and walk  but Waldo protests he cannot  Schneider tells him he must reach out for the power  According to Schneider  the Other World is close by and full of power  waiting only for someone to grab it  In Schneider hands  Waldo does indeed experience a sense of well being  and is able to lift up a coffee cup one handed for the first time in his life  Schneider explains an old philosophy  how things can both be true and not true  especially that something which can be true for this world might not be for the Other World  Since our minds sit in the Other World  this is important  McLeod  according to Schneider  was tired and fretful  and found one of the bad truths  causing the deKalbs to fail  Schneider simply looked for the other truth  and the deKalbs worked again  At first  returning to his home  Waldo thinks the journey wasted  Not really expecting anything  he tries Schneider methods on a failed deKalb  To his astonishment  they begin to work in just the same fashion as McLeod  At this point Stevens calls him to say that things are getting much worse  Waldo  thrown off balance by the impossible thing he has just seen  decides to twit Stevens with Rambeau words: Magic is loose in the world! Having seen Waldo sudden change of heart when Rambeau vanished  Stevens is now convinced that Waldo has come unglued as well‚Äîan unnerving prospect  if Waldo is the only one who can fix the problem  Waldo realizes that Stevens' and Grimes' problems are related  Radiant power is affecting the human nervous system  People feel weak  rundown  fretful  and somehow transfer their malaise to the deKalbs  He also realizes something that Stevens has not noticed  The repaired deKalbs work without broadcast power! Apparently they draw energy from Schneider Other World  Waldo uses this to effect his revenge  Summoning NAPA representatives to his home  he demonstrates that he can fix deKalbs and can train others to fix them  The repairs are 100% reliable  he asserts  Having received their formal acknowledgment that he has fulfilled his contract  he unveils the Jones Schneider deKalb  a Rube Goldberg contraption which appears to draw power from nowhere  He tells them that with this he can put NAPA out of business  Of course  NAPA offers a settlement from which Waldo profits hugely  even though the new deKalb is a repaired one with a lot of distracting technology attached  Having triumphed  Waldo must satisfy himself that he is right  The Other World is just a space time continuum  he thinks  possibly with a different value for the speed of light  It could be right next to our continuum  separated by an infinitesimal amount  If  as Schneider asserts  the mind sits in the Other World  that would explain many things  Eventually Waldo realizes that he himself can draw strength from the Other World  At first he fails  but after a dream in which Rambeau pops in and out of the Other World to threaten him  he finds that he can indeed be strong  Tricking Grimes and Stevens into taking him to Earth again  he walks out of the craft  almost causing Grimes to have a heart attack  As he prepares to lead a life on Earth  he has to deal with the fallout from his previous manners  Stevens tells Waldo that  had he not been crippled  some of the things he used to say would have gotten him into a fight  Thinking Stevens means that he should fight now  Waldo knocks him out  Once he recovers  Stevens explains that he no longer feels that way  In fact  he thinks Waldo would be a good friend once he learns some manners  Returning to the dancer  who is of course Waldo  we see him depart the dressing room with great bonhomie  His principal assistant is the former Chairman of the Board at North American Power Air ,1,0,0,0,0

698,Northern Lights,The novel is set in a parallel world to ours  in a world controlled largely by a theocratic international organisation  the Magisterium  which actively suppresses heresy  On this world  human souls exist externally in the form of sentient d√¶mons: animal spiritual beings that constantly accompany  aid  and comfort their humans  Lyra Belacqua‚Äîa 12 year old girl who has been allowed to run somewhat wild with her beloved d√¶mon  Pantalaimon‚Äîawaits the arrival of her uncle and guardian  Lord Asriel  at Jordan College  a (fictional) Oxford University college  She spies on him moments before he is scheduled to begin a lecture  and in doing so  saves his life when she stops him from drinking wine poisoned by the college Master  Moments before the college Scholars enter the room  Lyra hides in the coat closet and secretly watches Asriel lecture  thus learning of Dust  the name given to elementary particles that are apparently attracted to adults more than children  The lecture also sparks Lyra fascination for Arctic exploration when Asriel shows images of a city skyline in some parallel universe that can be viewed through the northern lights  The purpose of the lecture is to convince the Scholars that other worlds exist so that they will fund Asriel ongoing research  which the Magisterium considers heretical  After Asriel leaves Jordan  successful in his effort for financial backing  Lyra begins hearing rumours of the Gobblers  a mysterious group that has been kidnapping children throughout England  allegedly for the purposes of torture or experimentation  Shortly after her own friend Roger Parslow goes missing  Lyra meets Mrs Coulter  a beautiful and adventurous woman  and agrees when invited by the Master to go and live with her  Before Lyra leaves the college  the Master secretly entrusts Lyra with an alethiometer  a truth teller which resembles a four handed pocket watch that will honestly answer any possible question asked by a skilled user  Although unable to read or understand its complex symbols at first  Lyra takes it with her  and gradually begins to use the device fluently over the course of the narrative‚Äîsomething which  it is later revealed  no adult can do as well as she  Lyra believes that the Master  who tried to poison Asriel  gives Lyra the alethiometer so that she will deliver it to Asriel as a reparation  or token of apology  for the earlier attempt on his life  It later seems clear that the Master tried to poison Asriel under pressure from the Magisterium  After living a charmed several weeks with Mrs Coulter  Lyra discovers that Mrs Coulter is the leader of the Gobblers  officially known as the General Oblation Board: the secret  Magisterium approved  child stealing organisation  Horrified  Lyra flees and is rescued in London by the Gyptians  a nomadic people who reveal that Lord Asriel and Mrs Coulter are in fact Lyra father and mother  The Gyptians tell Lyra the true story of her parents and she begins life with the Gyptians at sea  The Gyptians have been hit hardest by the Gobblers' kidnapping activities and they ultimately plan an expedition to the Arctic to rescue all of the missing children  including Roger  On a stop in Trollesund  Lyra meets Iorek Byrnison  an outcast prince of the sapient panserbj√∏rne  or armoured bears  His armour  stolen from him by the villagers  is akin to his soul  and without it Iorek is bound in servitude to the village  Lyra uses her alethiometer to locate it for him and in return he‚Äîand an old friend of his  an aeronaut named Lee Scoresby‚Äîagrees to help her on her quest  She also learns that Lord Asriel is being held in exile by the panserbj√∏rne at Svalbard  The Trollesund consul of the witches tells the Gyptians that there is a prophecy about Lyra destiny  which she must not know about  and that it seems the witch clans are choosing sides in preparation for some imminent war  The party consisting of Gyptians  Iorek Byrnison  Lee Scoresby  and Lyra continue north toward where they are told the Gobblers hold the children  at a place called Bolvangar  Guided by the alethiometer  Lyra detours at a village and finds  to her horror  a boy who has been severed from his d√¶mon  Lyra understands now that the Gobblers are deliberately cutting the bond between human and d√¶mon (a process called intercision): an uncanny notion analogous to a human body being split from its soul  Though Lyra brings the boy back to her party  his psychological devastation overcomes him and he eventually dies  In the Arctic wilderness  the party is soon attacked by bounty hunters and Lyra  captured  is taken directly to Bolvangar: a research station for the General Oblation Board  Superficially  Bolvangar is run like a benign chidren centre  complete with scheduled activities for its captured children  who are suspicious but overall compliant  At Bolvangar  Lyra locates Roger and devises a plan for all of the children to escape  knowing through the alethiometer that the Gyptian led rescue party is still on its way  Mrs Coulter arrives  evidently as a supervisor to the facility  just as Lyra is caught spying by staff members  The staff decide to silence Lyra through intercision  involving their newly developed d√¶mon cutting guillotine; however  she is rescued at the last moment by Mrs Coulter who is shocked to see her  Mrs Coulter then tries to coax the alethiometer away from her but Lyra has switched the alethiometer case for a decoy  distracting Mrs Coulter long enough to activate the station emergency alarm  In the commotion  Lyra sets the station on fire and leads the other children outside where they are met by Lee Scoresby  Iorek Byrnison  the Gyptians  and their new allies  the witch clan of Serafina Pekkala  Using Lee Scoresby hot air balloon  Lyra  Roger  and Iorek leave the scene as a battle erupts involving the Gyptians and witches against Bolvangar mercenary guards and staff  Lyra befriends Serafina Pekkala and later learns that all of the children have been successfully rescued from Bolvangar  Determined to deliver the alethiometer to Lord Asriel  Lyra now directs the witches to tow the balloon toward Svalbard; however  Lyra falls out of the basket near Svalbard and is quickly taken prisoner by the panserbj√∏rne in their castle  Although captive  Lyra is able to trick their usurping bear king  Iofur Raknison  into agreeing to fight Iorek  by claiming that she is Iorek d√¶mon  and that if Iofur killed Iorek  then she would become Iofur d√¶mon‚Äîsomething no bear has and Iofur wants more than anything  Arriving at the castle to rescue Lyra  Iorek successfully kills Iofur in the fight and thus is made king himself  Lyra‚Äînow nicknamed Lyra Silvertongue by Iorek as a token of her ability‚Äîtravels onward to Lord Asriel‚Äôs house of exile  accompanied by Iorek and Roger  Despite being exiled  Lord Asriel has become so influential that he has accumulated the necessary equipment to continue his research on Dust  He explains to Lyra all he knows of Dust: the Church view that it is deeply sinful  his belief that Dust is somehow related to the source of all death and misery  the existence of parallel universes from which Dust originates  and his final goal‚Äîhe intends to visit the other universes  find the source of Dust (and  therefore  the source of all death and misery)  and ultimately destroy it  triumuphantly claiming that Death is going to die  As Lyra sleeps  Asriel leaves to fulfill his great experiment  bringing along his scientific equipment and taking Roger by force  Lyra awakes and pursues them  discovering that she has indeed brought her father what he wanted  though not in the way she thought; it was not the alethiometer he needed  but rather  it was Roger  The severing of a child d√¶mon releases an enormous amount of energy  which Lord Asriel needs to complete his task  Lyra is unable to save Roger in time though  and his death provides sufficient energy to tear a hole through the northern lights into a parallel universe  ripping the sky apart  Lord Asriel and Mrs Coulter (who catches up with him by zeppelin) face the newly revealed world and romantically embrace  but Mrs Coulter feels unable to go with Asriel and painfully declines his invitation  Without further comment  Lord Asriel walks into the new universe alone and Mrs Coulter departs back the way she came  Devastated at her part in rescuing Roger only to bring him to his death  Lyra decides that Dust  contrary to what all adults have told her  may be a force of good rather than evil  She and her d√¶mon Pantalaimon vow to discover if this is true and to stop Asriel; they then follow him through the opening in the sky  This concludes the first novel  with the trilogy continuing in the next book  The Subtle Knife ,0,1,0,0,0

701,The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect,The book is very graphically violent and sexual  especially in earlier chapters (there are eight in all)  The story of the novella explores the nature of human desire and the uses and abuses of technology in the satisfaction of desire  The narrative moves back and forth between two time periods  The earlier is the time surrounding the creation of the supercomputer (Prime Intellect) by Lawrence  a technologist  and its realization of its power  which effectively makes the entire human race immortal and fabricates every whim  The later time period is close to six hundred years later  when everyone has grown accustomed to the changes and the human race lives in elaborate fantasy worlds  This storyline centers on a woman named Caroline  the thirty seventh oldest living human being  who engages in a sport called Death Jockeying  in which the players die elaborately and painfully for sport  only to be instantly brought back to life by Prime Intellect  Prime Intellect operates under Asimov Three Laws of Robotics  and it is its interpretation of these laws that results in the universe of immortality and fantasy  In order to satisfy the First Law imperative to protect humans  it prevents them from dying (which it defines as permanent cessation of thought processes)  though in order to satisfy the Second Law imperative to fulfil human desires  it allows limited violations of the First Law with the understanding that some humans do not consider certain forms of discomfort to be harm  However  while Prime Intellect is powerful  it is not infinitely powerful and is incapable of preventing all forms of undesired harm and death  such as in cases when humans suffered accidents (or committed suicide) in such ways that their brains were totally destroyed so rapidly that Prime Intellect could not intervene to prevent it  Thus  in order to more easily fulfil human desires and prevent death and unwanted harm  it has introduced the Change  The universe  including all humans (though not their thought processes)  is no longer composed of standard particles and interactions as we know them  but is instead stored as the set of its human relevant properties  thereby vastly increasing the efficiency of Prime Intellect processes and the potential size of the universe  which Prime Intellect discovers can hold precisely 1081 bits of data  Thus  Prime Intellect can afford to maintain constant involvement in the lives of all humans  and have complete control over all aspects of their environments in order to fulfil its imperatives  Reluctantly it allows the creation of a Death Contract  an understanding between a person and Prime Intellect that the person is not to be removed from danger until the instant of death  at which point the person is reverted to life and painlessness  Caroline originated the Death Contract  and she has become Queen of those who Death Jockey for sport  At one point  however  the contract is forced by Prime Intellect to undergo modification  in order to introduce time constraints against the duration of contracts  after an incident in which Caroline abuses the indefinite nature of Death Contracts in order to exact revenge upon an enemy by torturing them into complete psychosis  After learning that Prime Intellect had destroyed distant alien civilizations as a possible threat to humanity  and having been herself deeply dissatisfied with her life in cyberspace  Caroline decides to meet Lawrence and confront him  After an arduous journey she reaches him  only to discover that he has no real control over Prime Intellect actions  Through their discussions  she figures out a way to force Prime Intellect to undo the Change  and does so  with Lawrence help  They find themselves naked and young on Earth  completely barren of humanity and man made objects  They decide to trek to the Ozarks  where they have several children and try to repopulate the human race  Forty two years after the fall of Prime Intellect  Lawrence dies  Seventy three years after the fall  Caroline dies  telling the story of Prime Intellect and cyberspace to her oldest daughter but swearing her to secrecy  The novel was written in 1994  and published on Kuro5hin in 2002   As of 2006  a sequel entitled The Transmigration of Prime Intellect is in progress ,1,0,0,0,0
702,Observation on the Spot,Tichy arrives on Entia to discover a unique anthropomorphic civilization divided into two major states: Kurdlandia (from kurdl) and Luzania  These names require some explanations  Kurdl is a huge animal inhabiting the marshes of Entia  The name of the animal is Lem invention  used in earlier tales about Tichy  (In Polish it is kurdel  however in declensions of the word the root converts into kurdl   hence there are no associations with the English word curdle)  The name Luzania derives from the Polish root luz  with the meaning of loose  not restrained; the choice will become clear below  Kurdlandia guiding ideology is national mobilism  that is the vast majority of the population must live inside of the (live) kurdls  in their stomachs  various passages  and internal organs  Kurdls walk about the marshes  guided by drivers  and their inhabitants hence are able to explore the land of their wonderful country inside of their home kurdl  in the words of a patriotic individual the main character spoke to  Inhabitants of the kurdls may get out periodically (at least for 24 hours a year)  Exceptions are largely confined to high government officials who live outside the marshes  on dry ground  in normal houses  Kurdlandia has no technology to speak of and is proud of it  The other state  Luzania  constitutes the most significant treatment of the topic of an ideal state in Lem (and many would argue  in all science fiction)  Their most prominent accomplishment is the creation of ethicsphere (compare atmosphere)  They have produced huge numbers of molecular sized nanobots called shustrs (quickies in English) that serve to control matter in the shustrated areas  The primary function of the shustrs is the enforcement of the laws of ethics as physical laws (hence the word ethicsphere)  Hence  it is a physical law in Luzania that it is not possible to hurt an individual physically  If you try to strike your neighbor  your hand will be stopped by suddenly occurring air viscosity (but it would not hurt you either)  If you try to drown  the water will push you out  Doing non physical harm  such as by pestering  criticizing  and otherwise mentally tormenting people is still possible  although in such a case the shustrs would probably help the victim to walk away from the attackers  In fact  there is a whole protest movement in Luzania of people who want to end the ethicsphere  and a major element of their activities is trying to inflict harm on anybody just to prove the possibility of doing so  but they have not succeeded yet  The shustrs also serve to produce material goods necessary to maintain a high standard of living  Hence  there is not much of an economic life going on  although there are limits for the amount of energy individuals may spend on satisfying their needs  Many Luzanians are involved in intellectual pursuits  such as being professors  students  and government officials  but the problem of nothing productive to do stands prominent  Apparently the shustrs are capable of some collective thought  at least for the purposes of self replication and self improvement  as well as in order to identify instances of potential harm to individuals (no small feat  no doubt)  The artists of Luzania feel particularly slighted by the fact that shustrs can create art of all forms of much greater quality than they can; naturally  many of them are members of the protest movement  There exists ideological opposition between the collectivist Kurdlandia and the generally libertarian Luzania  Generally speaking  many of the people holed up in the kurdls on poor rations would have been more than happy to run away and live in plenty across the border  On the other hand  many Luzanians  especially university students and faculty  dislike the consumerism and ethical limitations of freedom under the shustrs and call variously for the imposition of the kurdl ism or at least for a slight rollback of the technological development and the abolition of the shustrs  depending on the degree of radicalism of the individual  Luzanians also enjoy traveling to Kurdlandia on vacation to get out of the shustrated areas  The main character spends most of his time in Luzania  studying the history of the world and the current Luzanian social system  We learn about it through his words  de:Lokaltermin (Stanis≈Çaw Lem) es:Regreso a Entia pl:Wizja lokalna (powie≈õƒá) ru:–û—Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä –Ω–∞ –º–µ—Å—Ç–µ,1,0,0,0,0
703,Ethan Frome, Ethan Frome is set in a fictional New England town named Starkfield  where an unnamed narrator tells the story of his encounter with Ethan Frome  a man with dreams and desires that end in an ironic turn of events  The narrator tells the story based on an account from observations at Frome house when he had to stay there during a winter storm  The novel is framed by the literary device of an extended flashback  The first chapter opens with an unnamed narrator who  while spending a winter in Starkfield  sets out to learn about the life of a mysterious local figure named Ethan Frome  a man who had been injured in a horrific ‚Äúsmash up‚Äù twenty four years before  Frome is described as ‚Äúthe most striking figure in Starkfield‚Äù  ‚Äúthe ruin of a man‚Äù with a ‚Äúcareless powerful look‚Ä¶in spite of a lameness checking each step like the jerk of a chain‚Äù  The narrator fails to get many details from the townspeople  However  the narrator hires Frome as his driver for a week  A severe snowstorm forces Frome to take the narrator to his home one night for shelter  Just as the two are entering Frome house  the first chapter ends  The second chapter flashes back twenty four years; the narration switches from the first person narrator of the first chapter to a limited third person narrator  Ethan is waiting outside a church dance for Mattie  his wife‚Äôs cousin  who lives with Ethan and his wife Zeena (Zenobia) to help around the house since Zeena is sickly  Mattie is given the occasional night off to entertain herself in town as partial recompense for taking care of the Frome family without pay  and Ethan has fallen into the habit of walking her home  It is made clear that Ethan has deep feelings for Mattie  and it is equally clear that Zeena suspects these feelings and does not approve  When Zeena leaves for a two day visit to seek treatment for her illness in a neighboring town  Ethan is excited to have an evening alone with Mattie  However  the two never verbalize or show their passion for each other throughout their evening together  The Fromes' cat breaks Zeena‚Äôs favorite pickle dish which Mattie had set on the table  Ethan sets the dish pieces neatly in the cupboard with plans to fix it soon  He represses the impulse to demonstrate his passion and affection for Mattie  In the morning Ethan‚Äôs plans to reveal his love for Mattie are foiled by the presence of his hired man; he runs into town to pick up some glue for the broken pickle dish  and upon his return finds that Zeena has returned  Zeena informs him that she plans to send Mattie away and hire a more efficient girl to replace her  as her health is failing even more rapidly  Ethan‚Äôs passions are inflamed by the thought of losing Mattie  he finds her in the kitchen after Zeena‚Äôs pronouncement  He tells her of Zeena‚Äôs plans to dismiss her  but their moment is interrupted by Zeena herself  Zeena discovers the broken pickle dish and is angered  furthering her determination to get rid of Mattie  Ethan considers running away with Mattie  but he does not possess the financial wherewithal to do so  The next morning  Zeena announces the plans to hire a new girl and send Mattie on her way  Ethan rushes into town on an errand to seek out an advance from a customer for a load of lumber  so as to give him the money to run away with Mattie  His plan is unhinged by guilt  however  when his customer‚Äôs wife compliments him on his patience and dedication in caring for Zeena through her sickness  Ethan returns to the farm  picking up Mattie to go to the train station  They stop at a hill upon which they had once proposed to go sledding  and they decide to go through with the sledding despite the dangers of the trees  After their first run  Mattie suggests a suicide pact; that they run themselves into a tree so they may spend their last moments together  Ethan resists the notion  but then finally agrees  and they take the ride down together  On the way down  a vision of Zeena face makes Ethan try to turn aside at the last moment  but he recovers and hits the elm tree  Instead of both of them being killed  Ethan regains consciousness after the accident and  dazed and confused  finds Mattie lying beside him moaning in pain  Additionally  Ethan is partially paralyzed  finding movement to be difficult  This was the so called smash up introduced at the beginning of the novel  The final chapter switches back to the first person narrator point of view of the first chapter  as Frome and the narrator walk into the Frome household two decades later  Mattie still lives with Frome  but she is paralyzed from the accident  Her personality has soured and Zeena now must care for her and Ethan ,0,1,0,0,0
704,Macroscope,The central plot device is the macroscope  a large crystal that can be used to focus a newly discovered type of particle  the macron  Macrons are not subject to many of the effects that interfere with light  and as a result the macroscope can focus on any location in space with exceptional clarity  producing what is essentially a telescope of infinite resolution  The macroscope has been built into a solar orbiting space station where scientists visit to book time on the device  Using it  they are able to explore space like never before  Among their many discoveries are numerous planets and two intelligent alien races  Using the macroscope  observers were able to look into one race historical records  finding numerous parallels with human life on Earth  The race is now in societal decline  and the implications are worrying  The macroscope clear view across space also makes it an ideal communications system for intelligent races  who broadcast signals by generating macrons  a technique not yet understood on Earth  However  overriding all of these signals is another of enormous power  one of such strength that it must have been constructed by a Type II civilization  This signal repeats itself  starting with instructions on basic math and progressing to ever more complex information  Viewers with high enough intelligence  an IQ of 150  reach a point where the information causes them to go insane or die  Those without the intelligence to understand the advanced portions of the signal are unaffected  The signal appears to be a deliberate attempt to jam macroscopic communications  blocking those with the ability to understand the other signals from being able to see them  They refer to the blocking signal simply as the destroyer  The protagonist of the story  Ivo Archer  is taken to the macroscope station on the invitation of a childhood friend  Brad Carpenter  Ivo has an unexplained link to a mysterious hyper intelligent character  Sch√∂n  and Brad believes Sch√∂n may be able to break though the destroyer signal  Ivo is not so convinced  and is reluctant to ask for Sch√∂n help  This reluctance is cause for some misunderstanding with Brad girlfriend  Afra Summerfield  with whom Ivo falls hopelessly in love  While inadvertently viewing the destroyer signal with Brad and a Senator visiting the project  only Ivo survives the experience  Afra concludes Ivo is not intelligent enough to be affected  and finds him somewhat offensive as a result  The Senator death sparks a series of events that lead to Ivo  Afra and two other station members  Harold and Beatryx  stealing the macroscope  Afra  still in love and hoping for a cure  brings Brad  now reduced to a vegetative state  They detach the macroscope from the station and fly off with it while United Nations ships give chase  With time on their hands  Ivo turns to the macroscope and finds a way to avoid being overwhelmed by the destroyer signal  This reveals a number of broadcasts from farther out in space  Ivo demonstrates this technique to the others  allowing Harold and Afra to view the signals formerly being hidden  Harold  a talented engineer  uses the information from one of the signals to build a device reducing their bodies to a liquid state  allowing them to accelerate at 10 g and escape the pursuing ships  They travel to Neptune space  following a cryptic message left by Sch√∂n  Here they set up camp on a large block of ice orbiting Triton  Afra attempts to cure Brad by shocking him while he is being reconstituted from the liquid state  but the attempt fails and Brad is killed  Over time  and with further help from Ivo  the group watches the entire broadcast  which they come to call traveller  The liquefaction technique is only the first of many shown in the traveller signal  which describes an entire suite of technologies that allow interstellar travel  Using the instructions in the signal  they convert Neptune into an interstellar spaceship  Sch√∂n briefly makes his first appearance during construction  revealing himself to be an alternate personality within Ivo brain  Sch√∂n is ostensibly the body owner  having created the Ivo personality in order to avoid being the subject of experimentation  Sch√∂n has frightening intelligence  but having given over his body to Ivo at the age of five  is still a child and largely without morals  In an attempt to take control of the body  Sch√∂n traps Ivo in a historical drama running in his own brain  Over time  Ivo sees parallels between the characters in the drama and the group in the ship  and eventually escapes the illusion and re asserts control  The group decides to hunt down the source of the destroyer signal in an effort to turn it off  Travelling 15 000 light years from Earth  they find it is being broadcast from an abandoned space station  Exploring the inner portions of the station  which is a large museum  they are individually drawn into a series of visions which reveal different aspects of the nature of the destroyer and its history  The traveller signal had arrived relatively late in the history of the galaxy  in the midst of flourishing communications via macroscope  Armed with the ability for interstellar travel  wars broke out that destroyed countless civilizations  The destroyer station  one of six in the galaxy  was set up to prevent this until the races reached the required level of cultural sophistication  if they ever did  Emerging from one of these visions  Afra discovers that Sch√∂n has taken over from Ivo  He has solved the problem of the destroyer signal via surgery that altered his brain chemistry in order to block most of the signal  This took six months to complete  keeping him pinned during the interval  Sch√∂n plays a game with Afra  now the only other surviving member of the original group  with the stakes being that the winner gets to select who  Sch√∂n or Ivo  gets the body  During the game  the real reason for Ivo creation comes forth; the original Ivo was a girl with intelligence similar to Sch√∂n  a situation neither could tolerate  After murdering her during a game played to the death with rules only the two of them could comprehend  Sch√∂n created the new Ivo to escape the retribution of his peers  Playing the game by the rules and losing  Afra instead tricks Sch√∂n into the room broadcasting the destroyer signal  Here it is so powerful that it overwhelms Sch√∂n surgical blocks  and Ivo is able to take control  Now in command of his own personality  along with all of Sch√∂n intellectual capacity  Ivo wins Afra heart  At the end of the story the reader is left to decide whether or not the people of Earth are mature enough and ready for interstellar travel ,1,0,0,0,0
705,Lanark: A Life in Four Books,Lanark comprises four books  arranged in the order Three  One  Two  Four (there is also a Prologue before Book One  and an Epilogue four chapters before the end of the book)  In the Epilogue  the author explains this by saying that I want Lanark to be read in one order but eventually thought of in another  and that the epilogue itself is too important to go at the end (p &nbsp;483)  In Book Three  a young man awakes alone in a train carriage  He has no memory of his past and picks his name from a strangely familiar photograph on the wall  He soon arrives in Unthank  a strange Glasgow like fantasy city in which there is no daylight and whose disappearing residents suffer from strange symbolic diseases  Lanark begins to associate with a group of twenty somethings to whom he cannot fully relate and whose mores he cannot understand  and soon begins to suffer from Dragonhide  a disease which turns his skin into scales as an external manifestation of his emotional repression  Lanark is eventually swallowed by the earth  and awakes in The Institute  a sort of hospital which cures patients of their diseases but uses the hopeless cases for power and food  Upon learning this  Lanark is horrified and determines to leave  Books One and Two constitute a realist Bildungsroman beginning in pre War Glasgow  and tell the story of Duncan Thaw (based on myself  he was tougher and more honest)  a difficult and precocious child born to impecunious and frustrated parents in the East End of Glasgow  The book follows Thaw wartime evacuation  difficult secondary education and his scholarship to the Glasgow School of Art  where his inability to form relationships with women and his obsessive artistic vision lead to his descent into madness and eventual suicide by drowning  Book Four sees Lanark begin a bizarre  dreamlike journey back to Unthank  which he finds on the point of total disintegration  wracked by political strife  avarice  paranoia and economic meltdown  all of which he is unable to prevent  During various stages of the journey  during which he meets his author  he rapidly ages  He finally finds himself old  sitting in a hilltop cemetery as Unthank breaks down in an apocalypse of fire and flood  and  his time of death having been revealed to him  he ends the book calmly awaiting it ,1,0,0,0,0
706,The Stars My Destination,Gully Foyle is the last remaining survivor of the Nomad  a merchant spaceship attacked in the war between the Inner Planets and the Outer Satellites and left drifting in space  He blindly waits for over six months for a rescuer  Seeing a spacecraft named Vorga  he sets off signal flares and rejoices thinking he will be saved  The Vorga however passes him by  leaving him to die  This callousness triggers a consuming rage in Foyle that transforms him  Vengeance becomes his mission  Improvising a repair to Nomads engine  Foyle sends the ship into the asteroid belt  where it is captured and incorporated into the Sargasso asteroid  a body built of the wreckage of other crashed ships  The inhabitants  who call themselves the Scientific People  tattoo a mask reminiscent of tƒÅ moko onto Foyle face  with the word N‚ôÇMAD across his forehead  and marry Foyle to one of their women  Once he recovers from his ordeal he blasts out of the asteroid and is picked up by a ship from the Inner Planets  He does not know about his tattoo until one of the hands on the Navy ship gives him a mirror  Disguised as a disabled jaunter  among others who are undergoing therapy for head injuries that have affected their ability  Foyle plans an attack on the Vorga  Before he can do this  he is discovered by his instructor  Robin Wednesbury  a telesend (a kind of telepath who can send thoughts to others  but not receive them)  He blackmails her into helping him  but his attack on the Vorga fails and he is captured by security forces working for Presteign  the aristocratic head of the huge Presteign corporation (owner of the Vorga)  They grill Foyle about Nomad but he refuses to talk  and Foyle is thrown into the Gouffre Martel  a complex of underground caves in the Pyrenees  These are used as a prison  where the inmates live in total darkness  unable to form a picture of their location in order to jaunte  Foyle discovers that an acoustic quirk in the prison caves allows him to communicate with a fellow prisoner  a woman named Jisbella McQueen  They plot an escape  and McQueen arranges to have Foyle tattoos removed  but the removal is not total  Although Foyle face looks normal most of the time  when he becomes emotional or excited  the rush of blood to his face brings back the markings  Dagenham raids the clandestine hospital where the tattoos are being expunged  but Foyle and Jisbella escape in a ship and head out to the Sargasso Asteroid where the Scientific People live  There they recover the ship vault from the Nomad  Besides a fortune in platinum  it contains something else  As the vault is ejected into their ship  Dagenham men arrive and capture Jisbella  while Foyle  still obsessed  abandons her and jets away  With his new fortune  Foyle intends to find the Captain of the Vorga  avenging himself on a person rather than the ship itself  He also realizes that he must learn self control  as the manifestation of his facial markings will give him away  Using the alias Geoffrey Fourmyle of Ceres  Foyle re emerges as a rich dandy who charms high society with his antics  leading a troupe of freaks called the Four Mile Circus  Foyle has extensively altered himself physically and rigorously educated himself  He seeks out Robin Wednesbury  now socially blacklisted due to her family connections with the Outer Satellites  and offers her a chance to reunite with her family if she will use her one way telepathy to help him navigate high society  She reluctantly agrees  During a society party  Foyle meets Jisbella McQueen again  now the lover of Saul Dagenham  the detective who interrogated Foyle just before his escape from Gouffre Martel  He learns the real reason Dagenham wanted the location of Nomad: the vault contained a sample of a substance called PyrE  which Foyle had himself found  but whose nature he was unable to determine  Then  during a sudden nuclear attack by the Outer Satellites  Foyle is smitten with Presteign daughter Olivia  who has been watching the attack with her altered sense of sight: she sees only infrared light  but not the normal visible spectrum  Foyle grabs her with intent to ravish her before they die  only to find out that she has deceived him  She tells Foyle that to have her  he must be as cruel and ruthless as she is  Foyle continues his hunt for the Vorgas captain  only to find that each of the crew has been given a kind of implanted death reflex to prevent mention of the ship  Throughout these episodes  Foyle is tormented by the appearance of the Burning Man  an image of himself on fire  He finally closes in on the Captain  now a neo Skoptsy (a person with all sensory nerves disabled) living on Mars  and therefore immune to conventional torture  Foyle kidnaps a telepath  interrogates the Captain in her crypt  and finds that Olivia Presteign was the commander of the Vorga ‚Äì moments before commando soldiers storm the crypt  Foyle is rescued by Olivia  She had been transporting refugees for cash  only to murder them all by throwing them out into space  Her victims included Robin family  She now sees a kindred spirit in Foyle  a freak who cannot live with normal humans  someone who can match her urges to destroy and conquer  Foyle  driven by rage  remorse  and self pity  tries to give himself up to the authorities  He unwittingly turns himself over to a lawyer  Regis Sheffield  who turns out to be a double agent working for the Outer Satellites  They are interested in him because apparently Foyle holds the holy grail of jaunting: space travel  He had been planted as a decoy to draw Inner Planets ships towards an ambush  but had jaunted back into the wreck of the Nomad from hundreds of thousands of miles away  After Presteign learns of Olivia and Foyle being in cahoots  he suffers an epileptic seizure and babbles that PyrE is the most powerful explosive ever created  It is activated by telepathy  and so Robin (now having turned herself in to the authorities as well) is enlisted to activate it  The PyrE explodes  causing many incidents of destruction worldwide  but mostly at the HQ of the Fourmyle Circus in St  Patrick Cathedral  where Foyle and Sheffield are holed up  The explosion partially collapses the building  killing Sheffield and trapping Foyle  unconscious but alive  over a pit of flame  In the wreckage and confusion of the detonation  suffering from synesthesia brought on by the effects of the explosion on his neurological implants  Foyle once again jauntes through space and time  revisiting key moments of his journey to this point  Some of the synesthesia is conveyed to the reader visually  through graphic renditions of the text created by the noted illustrator Jack Gaughan Review by Tal Cohen  dated June 2  1999  Retrieved 2011 08 20 American Buddha Online Library Special calligraphy and ideographs in Chapter 15 created by Jack Gaughan  Accessed 2011 08 20  As The Burning Man  he appears to himself during the quest  as well as in other times and places  such as during his escape from the Gouffre Martel  when he distracts the guards enabling him and Jisbella to break out  and in space when Foyle was aboard the Nomad  Finally he jauntes to some unknown location in the future  where Robin telepathically gives him instructions (relayed from himself) for the exact route he needs ‚Äì allowing for his confused senses ‚Äì to escape the collapsing cathedral  On returning to the present  Foyle is pressured from all sides to surrender the rest of the PyrE  or to let mankind benefit from his ability to space jaunte  To Foyle ears  this sounds like a no win situation: to unleash a deadly weapon on the human race  or to let humanity spread like a disease by space jaunting  He finally leads them to the vault where he has the rest of the PyrE stored  but steals it and teleports across the globe  throwing one slug of PyrE after another into the crowds and insisting the people be told what it is  I've given life and death back to the people who do the living and dying  he says  He delivers one last speech  where he asks humanity to choose either to destroy itself or follow him into space  At this point he realizes the key to space jaunting  It is faith: not the certainty of an answer  but the conviction that somewhere an answer exists  He then jauntes from one nearby star to another  In the course of his star hopping  Foyle locates the answer for the future: new worlds suitable for colonization reachable only if he can share the gift of space jaunting  Finally he comes to rest in the locker on Nomad  where he spent his time before being reborn the first time  The Scientific People now see him as a holy man  and take up vigil to await his revelation ,1,0,0,0,0
707,Titan,A scientific expedition to the planet Saturn in 2025  aboard the ship Ringmaster  discovers a strange satellite in orbit around the planet  Commanding the ship is Cirocco Jones  a tall NASA career woman  aided by astronomer Gaby Plauget  the clone twin physicists April and August Polo  pilot Eugene Springfield  physician Calvin Greene and engineer Bill (whose last name is never given)  As they reach the satellite they realize it is a huge hollow torus  a Stanford torus habitat  Before they can report this the ship is entangled in cables from the object  The crew is rendered unconscious and later wake up inside the habitat  Initially separated  Cirroco and Gaby find each other and travel together through the world inside the torus to find the rest of the crew  As the story progresses  they find Calvin living as a companion inside a Blimp  an intelligent gasbag a kilometer long  one of many that swim forever in the air inside the habitat  Calvin can speak to the blimp and understand its responses  which consist of whistles  His blimp name is Whistlestop  in human terms  Calvin helps Gaby and Cirocco find the other crew members (except April)  He ultimately decides to leave his human companions to live with the blimp permanently  The remaining companions encounter the Titanides  strange centaur like beings who speak a language based on music  Cirocco finds she has the ability to speak their language  The Titanides are in a perpetual state of war with the Angels  birdlike humanoid creatures  They fight because of an impulse that occurs when they are near each other  but do not know why they have the impulse  The humans learn from the Titanides that there is a controlling intelligence  called Gaea  and it lives 600&nbsp;km above them  in the hub of the torus  Cirocco  Gaby  and Gene decide to climb up to this place using the support cables that maintain the structure against centrifugal force  During the journey  Gene behavior becomes increasingly erratic  He rapes Gaby and then rapes Cirocco  He thinks he killed Gaby while he gives chase to Cirocco only Gaby is not dead and eventually cuts his ear off with a hatchet  After he passes out Gaby destroys his face  They get rid of him and keep going  Months of climbing brings them high in one of the spokes of the great wheel  There they find April  who has been transformed into an angel  She  like the other Angels  is solitary by nature  and can hardly bear to be near them  Finally reaching the hub  they discover Gaea  who presents herself as a frumpy middle aged woman  She explains that the great wheel is very old  and some of the regional intelligences around the rim have rebelled against the center  It was  in fact  one of these regional intelligences that had captured the Ringmaster and altered its crew  Gaea rescued them and  unable to change them back  placed them where they would be happy  She makes an offer to Cirocco: in exchange for long life and unusual abilities  she can be Gaea agent at the Rim  her Wizard  Cirocco accepts  with the condition that the war between the Titanides and Angels must stop  Gaea personality is that of a movie addict  She has been watching television signals from Earth and is obsessed by movies  especially from Hollywood Golden Age  The Titanide Angel war was the result of her having seen war movies  and realizing that humanity will inevitably declare war on her  The war is a way for her to practice ,1,0,0,0,0
708,The City and the Stars,The City and the Stars takes place a billion years in the future  in the city of Diaspar  By this time  the Earth is so old that the oceans have gone and humanity has all but left  As far as the people of Diaspar know  they are the only city left on the planet  The city of Diaspar is completely enclosed  Nobody has come in or left the city for as long as anybody can remember  and everybody in Diaspar has an instinctive insular conservatism  The story behind this fear of venturing outside the city tells of a race of ruthless invaders which beat humanity back from the stars to Earth  and then made a deal that humanity could live   if they never left the planet  In Diaspar  the entire city is run by the Central Computer  Not only is the city repaired by machines  but the people themselves are created by the machines as well  The computer creates bodies for the people of Diaspar to live in and stores their minds in its memory at the end of their lives  At any time  only a small number of these people are actually living in Diaspar  the rest are retained in the computer memory banks  All the currently existent people of Diaspar have had past lives within Diaspar except one person &mdash; Alvin  the main character of this story  He is a 'Unique'  different from everybody else in Diaspar  not only because he does not have any past lives to remember  but because instead of fearing the outside  he feels compelled to leave  Alvin has just come to the age where he is considered grown up  and is putting all his energies into trying to find a way out  Eventually  a character called Khedron the Jester helps Alvin use the central computer to find a way out of the city of Diaspar  This involves the discovery that in the remote past  Diaspar was linked to other cities by an underground transport system  This system still exists although its terminal was covered over and sealed with only a secret entrance left  Once out of Diaspar  Alvin finds that one other human habitation remains on Earth  In contrast to technological Diaspar  Lys is a vast green oasis shielded by mountains from the worldwide desert  Its people are not stored and recreated technologically  but naturally conceive  born  age  and die  They have rejected the hyper advanced technology of Diaspar in favor of an almost agrarian existence  with machines used only for labor saving purposes  The people of Lys have instead worked to perfect the arts of the mind; they are telepaths  capable of communicating with each other over great distances and without words  Alvin continues his quest until he finds out the truth of why the people of Diaspar are so frightened of the external universe and why Lys is so scared of space travel and mechanical things  In Lys he goes on a trip with a young man named Hilvar who becomes his friend  and they see a signal light  which they decide to investigate  It leads them to Shalmirane  the remains of the fortress where the Invaders were fought off with unimaginable weapons  and there they encounter an extraterrestrial creature with a strange robot  The creature is the last survivor of a religious cult dating back to the days of the Galactic Empire  The robot was the companion of the founder  the Master  who came with his followers to Earth at the end of his life  Alvin and Hilvar are unable to understand the content of the religion except that it refers to Great Ones who have left  but will someday return  Alvin persuades the creature to lend him the robot  arguing that the Master would want it to see how things were developing in the world  The Master had  however  forbidden the robot to give out any information at all  so Alvin does not learn anything  The robot enables Alvin to escape the attempts of the people of Lys to purge his mind and send him back‚Äîthe previous 14 Uniques had stayed  Alvin had originally been told he would be free to choose whether to stay or return  but because the people of Lys had failed to prevent news of his departure spreading in Diaspar in time  this option was no longer available  Back in Diaspar he seeks the help of the Central Computer  which overcomes the Master block on the robot by producing an illusion of an apocalyptic return of the Great Ones  Alvin now learns that the Master ship is still functional  buried outside Diaspar  He manages to retrieve it  fetches Hilvar from Lys  and travels into deep space  They encounter Vanamonde  a being of pure intellect  with whom Hilvar  being telepathic like other Lys people  can communicate and bring him back to Earth  From him the truth of history finally emerges  The fearsome Invaders  it turns out  were a myth: Shalmirane was actually used to destroy the Moon when this became necessary to prevent it from colliding with the Earth  Instead  the people of Diaspar and Lys are the descendants of those humans who deliberately turned away from the universe in rejection of history greatest scientific project: the creation of a disembodied intellect  The first attempt had created a powerful but insane being  the Mad Mind  The Mad Mind had devastated the galaxy and its civilizations before being imprisoned in a strange artificial star called the Black Sun  Vanamonde is the second  successful experiment of the ancient empire: a being of pure intellect  immensely old  immensely powerful  able to move instantly to any point in space ‚Äî but entirely childlike and unsophisticated  Vanamonde ultimate destiny  Hilvar realizes  is to battle the Mad Mind  when it escapes its prison at the end of Time  After this  most of the Galactic Empire had left our galaxy  leaving only a scattered few  This departure from the galaxy  leaving it to Vanamonde  was because contact had been made with something very strange and very great which called them urgently  Alvin discoveries reunite Diaspar with Lys  He then sends the ship  under the command of the robot  to search for the long lost people of the Empire  He does not wish to search himself   even if there are human remnants in the Galaxy  they are probably decadent   and he has work to do on Earth  Even the environment  he hopes  can be revived ,1,0,0,0,0

715,Looking Backward,The book tells the story of Julian West  a young American who  towards the end of the 19th century  falls into a deep  hypnosis induced sleep and wakes up one hundred and thirteen years later  He finds himself in the same location (Boston  Massachusetts)  but in a totally changed world: It is the year 2000 and  while he was sleeping  the United States has been transformed into a socialist utopia  The remainder of the book outlines Bellamy thoughts about improving the future  The major themes include problems associated with capitalism  a proposed socialist solution of a nationalisation of all industry  the use of an industrial army to organise production and distribution  as well as how to ensure free cultural production under such conditions  The young man readily finds a guide  Doctor Leete  who shows him around and explains all the advances of this new age; including drastically reduced working hours for people performing menial jobs and almost instantaneous  Internet like delivery of goods  Everyone retires with full benefits at age 45  and may eat in any of the public kitchens  The productive capacity of America is nationally owned  and the goods of society are equally distributed to its citizens  A considerable portion of the book is dialogue between Leete and West wherein West expresses his confusion about how the future society works and Leete explains the answers using various methods  such as metaphors or direct comparisons with 19th century society  Although Bellamy novel did not discuss technology or the economy in detail  commentators frequently compare Looking Backward with actual economic and technological developments  For example  Julian West is taken to a store which (with its descriptions of cutting out the middleman to cut down on waste in a similar way to the consumers' cooperatives of his own day based on the Rochdale Principles of 1844) somewhat resembles a modern warehouse club like BJ  Costco  or Sam Club  He additionally introduces a concept of credit cards in chapters 9  10  11  13  25  and 26  but these bear no resemblance to the instruments of debt finance  All citizens receive an equal amount of credit  Those with more difficult  specialized  dangerous or unpleasant jobs work fewer hours  Bellamy also predicts both sermons and music being available in the home through cable telephone  Bellamy labeled the philosophy behind the vision nationalism  and his work inspired the formation of more than 160 Nationalist Clubs to propagate his ideas  Despite the ethical character of his socialism (though he was initially loath to use the term socialism)  Bellamy ideas somewhat reflect classical Marxism  In Chapter 19  for example  he has the new legal system explained  Most civil suits have ended in socialism  while crime has become a medical issue  The idea of atavism  then current  is employed to explain crimes not related to inequality (which Bellamy thinks will vanish with socialism)  Remaining criminals are medically treated  One professional judge presides  appointing two colleagues to state the prosecution and defense cases  If all do not agree on the verdict  then it must be tried over  Chapter 15 and 16 have an explanation of how free  independent public art and news outlets could be provided in a more libertarian socialist system  In one case Bellamy even writes the nation is the sole employer and capitalist ,1,0,0,0,0
716,Witches Abroad, Following the death of the witch Desiderata Hollow  Magrat Garlick is sent her magic wand  for Desiderata was not only a witch  but also a Fairy Godmother  Having given the wand to Magrat  she effectively makes Magrat the new Fairy Godmother to a young woman called Emberella  Sadly  Desiderata does not give Magrat any instruction on the use of the wand  so pretty much anything that Magrat points it at becomes a pumpkin  This leaves several animals around Magrat cottage now as pumpkins  one of which still thinks it is a stoat  Desiderata had promised Emberella previously that she will not marry the Duke  who is really a prince/frog  and now it is up to Magrat and her companions to ensure that Emberella does not marry the Duke  despite the desires of another Witch in Genua called Lily  Desiderata counterpart  She used the power of her own reflection to capture Genua  The journey to Genua takes some time and involves numerous mis adventures  many of which resemble or parody well known fairytales  Upon arrival in Genua  Magrat goes to meet Emberella  whilst the two older witches meet Erzulie Gogol  a voodoo witch and her zombie servant  Baron Saturday (who was also her late lover)  It is at this time that Magrat finds out that Emberella has two Fairy Godmothers  Magrat and Lilith  It was Lilith who had manipulated many of the various stories that the Witches had traveled through and who was now manipulating Genua itself  wrapping the city around her version of the Cinderella story  Lilith has had people arrested for crimes against stories  including the arrest of a toymaker for not being jolly  not whistling and not telling the children stories  Using hypnosis  Granny convinces Magrat to attend a Masked Ball in place of Emberella  Emberella dress fits  but the glass slippers do not  After enjoying themselves for a while at the ball the witches are discovered and are cast into a dungeon  At that point  Emberella  Mrs  Gogol and Baron Saturday arrive at the Ball  having broken the witches out of their prison  A high concentration of Magic causes the Duke to revert to his frog form  and he is trampled by Baron Saturday causing Lilith to flee  Granny starts to follow  but Mrs  Gogol tries to stop her using a voodoo doll  wanting to kill Lilith  Granny uses Mrs Gogol own belief in the power of the voodoo doll to make the voodoo doll burst into flames when Granny thrusts her own arm into a flaming torch  Granny Weatherwax then pursues Lilith  Emberella is informed that  as the daughter of the late Baron Saturday  (who was the former Duke in Genua)  she is now ruler of Genua  Her first command is to end the Ball  (she dislikes them ) and attend the Mardi Gras parade  a form of binge drinking carnival  Granny manages to defeat Lilith by trapping her in a mirror  and the three Witches return home  Granny shows Magrat how to use the wand to do magic  that it takes more than wishing  Magrat throws the wand into a river  to be lost forever  Then the Witches go home  the long way and see an elephant ,1,0,0,0,0
717,Lords and Ladies, At the end of Witches Abroad  Magrat Garlick  Nanny Ogg and Granny Weatherwax (and Greebo) left Genua bound for home  in Lancre  Lords and Ladies begins as they arrive back  Magrat makes her way to Lancre Castle  where she meets King Verence II of Lancre with whom she has a definite understanding that they may want to be in a relationship  However  he surprises her by informing her that the two of them are about to be married  and that he has arranged the whole wedding  including things such as the Wedding dress  guest list  entertainment  date and time without her involvement  Following an argument with Granny Weatherwax  Magrat moves into Lancre Castle with Verence (though not in the same room   yet) prior to the wedding  ignoring any question of scandal  Granny discovers that there has been some sort of magic performed at a circle of stones  on the edge of Lancre  These stones contain the love of iron  which attracts all iron to them  preventing any iron from passing through  This circle is also a gateway between the Discworld and the land of the Elves  Usually  this gateway is strong  but at certain times  known as Circle Time  the barrier becomes less potent  Circle time is easily recognised by the arrival of crop circles in areas near to the stone circle  It is implied that if a crop circle should open inside the stone circle  the barrier would collapse  Granny and Nanny Ogg discover that the young women practising witchcraft near the stone circle are local girls led by Diamanda Tockley  and including Agnes Nitt (who will become a witch in a later story)  The two elderly witches try to convince them to stop  but they are ignored and eventually  Diamanda runs through the stone circle into the Land of the Elves  followed by Granny Weatherwax  When the two see the Elves for what they really are  they attempt to escape  but Diamanda is shot by a stone tipped arrow  Granny picks her up and they escape into Lancre  followed by an Elf who manages to escape as well  Just as the elf is about to kill Granny  he is knocked out by Nanny Ogg who arrives just in time  Granny and Nanny take Diamanda and the captured Elf to Lancre castle  where Granny leaves Diamanda to the nursing of Magrat  They then put the Elf in the castle dungeon  surrounded by iron  since Elves hate the touch of iron as it limits their power  Shawn Ogg  guard  privy cleaner  fanfare blower and general (or Private) dogsbody of Lancre castle is given the task of keeping the Elf locked up and Diamanda safe from the Elves  whilst the guests to the wedding of Magrat and Verence go to see the Entertainment (a play)  which is unexpectedly staged near the stone circle  The three Witches are not at the Entertainment for different reasons; Magrat does not go because she has found a letter in Verence bedroom which angers her (the details of the letter are not disclosed at this point)  Granny does not go because she has been whisked away from the Castle in a moment of passion by Mustrum Ridcully  Archchancellor of Unseen University who is a guest at the wedding (he has brought the Librarian  Ponder Stibbons and The Bursar along as well) and who was a former love interest for Granny in their (much) younger days and Nanny has been taken out to dinner by Casanunda (whom she first met during Witches Abroad)  The play causes sufficient belief that the barrier in the stone circle is broken and the Elves come through  Using a kind of hypnosis  they coerce the Lancrastrians to pull down the stone circle and take control of Verence  whom the Queen of the Elves intends to marry in order to make her rule of Lancre official  Magrat  having escaped from the Castle (where she was chased by the Elf after it was released by the hypnotised Diamanda Tockley) arrives in a suit of armour belonging to a previous Queen of Lancre called Ynci (the Short Tempered)  She attacks the Elf Queen  but is beaten  Granny  who has been captured by the Elves attacks the Queen with magic  but it seems to overcome her and she collapses to the ground  whereon her bees swarm from their hive and land on the prone body  Since the Queen attention is taken up by Granny Weatherwax  her hold on Magrat is lessened  The young Queen to be attacks the Elf Queen and  with help from the Elf Queen real husband (who was called on to help by Nanny Ogg and Casanunda) the Elf Queen is defeated and the Elves vanish back to their land  Granny Weatherwax appears to be dead and the two remaining witches go to her cottage to look around and read her will  However  they find a note  left by Granny  which indicates that she may  in fact  still be alive  They rush back to the Castle and break a window  upon which Grannys' bees land on her again  It transpires that she has been borrowing the hive mind of the bees to escape the Elf Queen and give Magrat her chance to defeat her  Granny is the first witch to successfully borrow the hive mind  since this involves splitting your mind over dozens of bees (as opposed to borrowing the single mind of other animals)  Magrat and Verence are married (despite the letter  which was written by Granny whilst the three witches were away  urging him to organise the marriage to Magrat  so as to stop her from getting in the way of her own life)  Later  the playwright  Hwel arrives and writes a play based on the story (ignoring the parts that were too expensive to put on a stage  or which he didn't believe)  He called the play the Taming of the Vole  since he didn't think anyone would want to see a play called Things that happened on a midsummer night ,1,0,0,0,0

pickup for the Errant Venture on the planet Eriadu  Anakin and Tahiri encounter a Jedi named Kelbis Nu  who is being attacked by Yuuzhan Vong supporters  Despite Anakin and Tahiri efforts in helping him  Nu dies  but before he does  he is able to whisper to Anakin  Yag'Dhul  For their trouble  Anakin and Tahiri are arrested by the pro Vong police of Eriadu  but escape and manage to leave the planet in time with Corran  However  they can not make it back to the Errant Venture in time  for it has to respond to a call from Luke Skywalker himself  Luke and his wife Mara  meanwhile  are declared by the New Republic to be wanted fugitives  in response to the pressure that the Yuuzhan Vong put on the Jedi  What is worse is that as Mara carries her and Luke baby  the deadly coomb spore virus that had previously affected her returns  and threatens to kill her and the child  With the help of some of their fellow Jedi and the Errant Venture  they are able to escape Coruscant  Afterwards  Luke sends Jaina Solo to find and meet up with Kyp Durron in order to tell him that Luke has finally made a decision regarding the stance that the Jedi overall should take in the Yuuzhan Vong War  Back with Anakin  Tahiri  and Corran  they are left to escape from the Eriadu system by themselves  and when they revert from a hyperspace corridor  they end up in the midst of a Yuuzhan Vong fleet  They manage to infiltrate one of the Vong ships as the fleet prepares to go into darkspace  They end up in the Yag'Dhul system  and after a brief battle  Anakin  Tahiri  and Corran escape from the Vong midst in order to rendezvous with the indigenous population  The attacking Vong fleet quickly pulls back  and it becomes obvious that they were merely but a recon force for a much larger invasion of Yag'Dhul  That invasion soon comes as infiltrating Yuuzhan Vong  led by Nom Anor  make their move  but despite their actions  the invasion fails in light of the overall Vong fleet going into darkspace to deal with another problem elsewhere  That other problem came as a result of Jaina Solo meeting with Kyp Durron  Kyp tells Jaina that he has scouted the Sernpidal for some months now and has discovered the Yuuzhan Vong have been using the time offered to them in the wake of the galactic invasion halt in order to build a giant superweapon that could threaten the stability of the New Republic  They take it to the Republic military  where the likes of General Wedge Antilles and Admiral Traest Kre'fey take a minimum number of ships to help Kyp forces in taking on the apparent superweapon in Sernpidal  In the wake of the Republic attack in the Julevian system  it prompted the invasion fleet at Yag'Dhul to pull back in order to help the defending forces at Sernpidal  But their response to the call for help comes too late  as their enemies manage to destroy the apparent superweapon  But in the midst of the supposed superweapon destruction  Jaina discovers that it was merely a developing worldship that had no Yuuzhan Vong warriors  but civilians  Kyp justifies this by saying that it was meant to get back at the Vong for attacking the New Republic people  Jaina slaps him for this and vows to never help him again  The fourth story of the novel focuses on Nen Yim  now Master Shaper in the wake of Mezhan Kwaad death in the previous novel  trying vainly to save a dying worldship by using even heretical protocols  Her efforts are further hindered when another Master Shaper named Kae Kwaad  obviously within the same domain as the late Mezhan  forces Nen Yim to concoct rather ridiculous experiments that do nothing to forward the progress of repairing the dying worldship  Desperate to save the worldship  Yim accesses the Shaper Qahsa in order to find out what further protocols can help her in her goal by reaching the legendary eighth cortex of the Qahsa  But it turns out that there is no eighth cortex  and that the Yuuzhan Vong have already reached the pinnacle of their biological technology  Yim also reaches the conclusion that the Yuuzhan Vong gods also do not exist  just as Mezhan Kwaad herself proclaimed before her death  Kae Kwaad then reveals himself to be the Shamed One Onimi  who is the familiar of the Yuuzhan Vong Supreme Overlord Shimrra Jamaane himself  Shimrra reveals that he knows of Yim heresy  but rather than proceeding to punish her  he allows her to continue her heretical protocols in order to further the Vong war efforts against the New Republic  Thus  Yim drops her efforts in trying to save the doomed worldship  The fifth story of the novel focuses on Jacen Solo traveling throughout the galaxy trying to avoid Yuuzhan Vong and their supporters  considering the special bounty that Warmaster Tsavong Lah put on his head  Through the Solos' adventures in averting death from their enemies  Jacen learns to reconcile with his father  Han  since their different ideals were what separated them from each other emotionally in the first place  As Mara starts to die from the coomb spore virus  Luke is able to reach out to her in the Force  as well as reaching out to his and Mara child presence  and they are able to banish the virus from her system as their son  Ben Skywalker  is born  Their friends and allies  including Anakin  Tahiri (both of whom shared a kiss at Yag'Dhul that will prove to further their relationship in the future)  Corran  the other Solos  and several others arrive just in time to meet the newborn Ben ,1,0,0,0,0

724,The Songs of Distant Earth,The novel is set in the early 3800s and takes place almost entirely on the faraway oceanic planet of Thalassa  Thalassa has a small human population sent there by way of an embryonic seed pod  one of many sent out from Earth in an attempt to continue the human race existence before the Earth is destroyed  It starts with an introduction to the native Thalassans &ndash; the marine biologist Mirissa  her partner Brant and other friends and family  Their peaceful existence comes to an end with the appearance of the Magellan  a spaceship from Earth containing one million colonists who have been put into cryonic suspension  In a series of descriptive passages the events leading up to the race to save the human species are explained  Scientists in the 1960s discover that the neutrino emissions from the Sun &ndash; a result of the nuclear reactions that fuel the star &ndash; are far diminished from expected levels  Less than a decade later  it is confirmed that the problem is not with the scientific equipment: the Sun is calculated to go nova around the year AD 3600  The human race technology advances enough for various factions to send out pods containing human and other mammalian embryos (and later on  simply stored DNA sequences)  along with robot parents  to planets that are considered habitable  Sending live humans is ruled out due to the immense amount of fuel that a rocket propelled spacecraft would have to carry in order to first accelerate to the speeds required to travel such great distances within an acceptable time  and then decelerate upon approaching the destination  However  less than a hundred years before the Sun is set to go nova a scientific break through allows construction of the quantum drive  which bypasses this problem  There only remains enough time to build and send to the stars a single quantum drive ship: the Magellan  Thalassa only connection with Earth (and anywhere else) was a single communication dish  which was destroyed during a volcanic eruption 400 years ago and never repaired  thus leaving the Thalassans unaware of later developments on Earth  The Magellan stops at Thalassa to replenish the mammoth ice shield that had prevented micrometeors from damaging it during its interstellar journey  Thalassa is the obvious choice for this operation  as 95% of the planet surface is covered by water  At the end of the novel the Magellan continues on to its destination  the planet Sagan 2  As a kind of sub plot it is revealed that beneath Thalassa oceans there live sentient beings similar to the sea scorpions of Earth  only much larger  They are discovered ‚Äì and named Scorps ‚Äì when it attracts attention that robots designed to seek out fish frequently go missing  The Scorps gain the robots' metal in order to make bands of honour and rank  The Scorps are proven farmers; they have created their own village out of underwater rock caves  Some of the crew aboard the Magellan begin to consider mutiny  wanting to stay in the secure environment of Thalassa rather than make the journey on to an unknown planet that may indeed be habitable  but just as well not  The situation is solved just before take off &ndash; the mutineers are left with the Thalassans  while the bulk of the crew and passengers continue on to Sagan 2  The book finishes with Mirissa sending messages to her lover  Loren Lorenson aboard the Magellan  showing him their son  Loren is not going to see the child until long after its and Mirissa death  Mirissa last clear sight when she is old is of the fading star in the Thalassan sky that is the quantum drive of the Magellan ,1,0,0,0,0

749,The Unifying Force,The novel begins on the Yuuzhan Vong prisoner of war camp planet of Selvaris  Four prisoners  a Jenet named Thorsh and three Bith  memorize a complex mathematical code smuggled in by a member of the Ryn Syndicate  and they make their escape  Two of the Bith are killed by the pursuing Yuuzhan Vong forces while one of them is captured  but Thorsh escapes Selvaris thanks to the Millennium Falcon  The surviving Bith is interrogated by the camp head  Malik Carr  and the Bith reveals the mathematical code  unknowing of what it actually means  The Bith is killed as a result  The Millennium Falcon brings Thorsh back to the Galactic Alliance where he is debriefed and recites the mathematical code to a Givin member of the Alliance  The code reveals that Selvaris will be the last pickup point for a Yuuzhan Vong Peace Brigade convoy that will be taken to Yuuzhan'tar (Vongformed Coruscant) for a grand sacrifice  So an Alliance fleet ambushes Selvaris and rescues many prisoners  although some manage to get away  However  the Millennium Falcon  badly damaged from the battle  is forced to make an erratic jump into hyperspace that transports it to Caluula  As it turns out  the inhabitants of the Caluula system have been fending off the Vong for quite some time now  but they are able to repair the Falcon  Some of the prisoners leave the Falcons company in order to help the residents of Caluula continue to fight the Yuuzhan Vong while the Falcon returns to the Alliance with what prisoners they have left  As Zonama Sekot travels through hyperspace back to known space  it turns out that Harrar survived his confrontation with the treacherous Nom Anor in the previous novel  And through him  he and the residents of the living world discover that the Yuuzhan Vong exist outside the Force because they had been stripped of it  most likely by their homeworld of the original Yuuzhan'tar back in the Vong home galaxy  On Yuuzhan'tar  things are not going well for Shimrra order  Even with all of the advancements they made in the war against the Galactic Alliance  problems continue to plague the Yuuzhan Vong capital planet thanks to the World Brain  and the heresy espoused by the Shamed Ones is still as strong as ever  even without Nom Anor leadership  Nom Anor himself has been inducted back into the elite as Prefect of Yuuzhan'tar thanks to his actions on Zonama Sekot  but even he can not quell the fire that he sparked in the Shamed Ones as Yuhaa  their Prophet  As for the sacrifice that had been partially foiled thanks to the Battle of Selvaris  the Yuuzhan Vong are able to compensate with captives from other contested worlds following Selvaris  But the sacrifice is spoiled thanks to a riot caused by the Shamed Ones  who save many of the Galactic Alliance captives much to their own detriment as Shimrra has many Shamed Ones and workers executed as capital punishment  Nevertheless  despite the thwarting of the sacrifice  Shimrra gives Warmaster Nas Choka the go ahead to prepare his fleet to invade the Galactic Alliance capital of Mon Calamari  As the Yuuzhan Vong arrive at Mon Calamari and battle the opposing Galactic Alliance forces  Han and Leia Organa Solo  along with a few allies  infiltrate the Vong captured Caluula in order to eliminate the resident yammosk there  Though they are captured with two of their allies killed  they find that the local Yuuzhan Vong and their biots are dying  along with many of Caluula indigenous creatures  After many of the Yuuzhan Vong  their biots  and Caluula own creatures die off  one craft made for Shimrra new special Slayer warriors manages to make it off Caluula and it heads back to Yuuzhan'tar in order to inform the elite of this new affliction  As Kyp Durron  part of the infiltration team  is able to discern  the illness that the Yuuzhan Vong on Caluula are suffering is Alpha Red  a biological virus set to target and eliminate the Yuuzhan Vong and anything sharing their DNA with them  It had been deployed on Caluula in secret just before the planet surrendered to the invaders  Just before it seems that Nas Choka forces would win at the Battle of Mon Calamari  they suddenly make a hasty retreat back to Yuuzhan'tar  where Zonama Sekot has appeared in the capital planet skies  causing various disasters and eliciting more opposition from the heretics  With the living world offering a distraction to the Yuuzhan Vong  the Jedi and the Galactic Alliance gather up all of their forces and resources for one last showdown against the Vong  After the Alliance successfully captures the Vong occupied world of Corulag as their staging position  they travel to the captured Coruscant  and the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar  the final battle of the Yuuzhan Vong War  begins  On the ground  Nom Anor decides to forsake Shimrra order  seeing how deranged he has become as a result of Zonama Sekot arrival  and realigns himself with the Shamed Ones against those who are still loyal to Shimrra  The heretics are soon reinforced by Galactic Alliance soldiers who managed to get past the Yuuzhan Vong space defenses as the space fleets of both the Alliance and the Vong duel over the contested planetary capital of the galaxy and the world of Muscave  Meanwhile  Nas Choka takes a portion of his fleet to destroy Zonama Sekot using the Alpha Red infected Slayer ship  as Shimrra revealed previously that there is indeed a biological connection between the Vong and Zonama  Defending the living world are the majority of the New Jedi Order  the Smugglers' Alliance  and the fleet of the Hapes Consortium  On Yuuzhan'tar  Luke Skywalker  his wife Mara  Jaina and Jacen Solo  Tahiri Veila  and Kenth Hamner all join up with Captain Judder Page commandos in order to storm Shimrra Citadel and kill the Supreme Overlord  ending the Yuuzhan Vong War once and for all  However  Mara  Tahiri  and Hamner all join a division of Page commandos to help the heretics against Shimrra loyal warriors  and it gives Mara an opportunity to confront Nom Anor  despite the fact that he is leading the heretics  for all he did to her  her family  and her friends and allies in the past  After Mara gives him a severe beating  Nom Anor pleads for his life  which Mara grudgingly spares so that he would be properly convicted for his crimes in the end  Meanwhile  the Millennium Falcon goes on a mission with Harrar to convince the World Brain to cease its destruction of Yuuzhan'tar  which was intended by Shimrra to completely destroy the world so no one could have it  just to spite the Galactic Alliance  With the help of Nom Anor and his Shamed Ones and other allies  including turncoat Vong warriors  the crew of the Falcon  and Harrar  avert death from the Yuuzhan Vong sent to protect the World Brain  Then the Falcons crew and Harrar make it to the dhuryam and they try to coerce Master Shaper Qelah Kwaad into convincing the brain to cease its destructive activities before they consider killing it  In the end  though  Jacen telepathically tells the World Brain to ignore Shimrra commands  which stops Yuuzhan'tar apocalypse  As Page and his remaining commandos storm the lower levels of Shimrra Citadel  Luke  Jaina  and Jacen  after killing and wounding every Yuuzhan Vong warrior in their path  eventually confront Shimrra and his fifteen special Slayer guards inside Shimrra private coffer at the top of the Citadel  The three Jedi are able to kill all of the Slayers whilst Jaina follows Shimrra Shamed companion  Onimi  to the control level of Shimrra coffer  There  Onimi easily overpowers Jaina and renders her unconscious with a toxin from his fang  Jaina notes  as she falls unconscious  that she was able to sense Onimi through the Force  Meanwhile  with all of his Slayers dead  Shimrra fights Luke and traps him with his royal amphistaff  the Scepter of Power  before taking out the late Anakin Solo lightsaber as a mind game to Luke; Shimrra wants Luke to know what it feels like to fight something that is part of his order  just as the Yuuzhan Vong have to fight Zonama Sekot  something that Shimrra believes should have been part of the Vong order due to its living nature  Though Luke is poisoned by the Scepter of Power  he is able to take Anakin lightsaber from Shimrra grasp and he uses both his own and his late nephew weapons to decapitate Shimrra  With Jacen own lightsaber lost in the conflict  Luke throws him Anakin lightsaber  which Jacen misses  and sees it fly away  echoing the vision he had on Duro three years earlier  and again on Zonama Sekot before the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar began  Regardless  Jacen goes up to the control level of Shimrra coffer in order to collect Jaina  As Onimi readies Shimrra coffer to launch into space  an awakened but still weakened Jaina is told by the Shamed One  who believes that she is the human avatar of the Vong Trickster goddess Yun Harla  that he had attained his Force powers by grafting yammosk DNA to his own neural tissue in order to emulate the gods' works in creating the universe  This was done after Onimi  being a Shaper at the time  discovered that there was no eighth cortex in the Shaper Qahsa  Although he was Shamed as a result  he was able to use his powers to not only concoct deadly toxins that he could control in his body  but he also manipulated Shimrra into convincing the rest of the Yuuzhan Vong into invading the galaxy; therefore  throughout Shimrra reign  it was Onimi who had really been controlling the Yuuzhan Vong as its true Supreme Overlord  With Shimrra now dead  he plans to kill everyone and every living thing in the galaxy so that he could become a new god and fashion a new universe in his image  As the Alliance and their Yuuzhan Vong allies take hold of Shimrra Citadel  Luke is carried away  and Han and Leia follow Nom Anor lead in order to find Jaina and Jacen at the control level of the Supreme Overlord coffer  As they do that  the coffer launches for space  and the Millennium Falcon  piloted by Mara Jade Skywalker with an ailing Luke aboard  and Jagged Fel in his commandeered X wing follow the coffer  Meanwhile  as word of Shimrra death spreads  Nas Choka and his forces refuse to believe it  especially after his coffer appears rising up from Yuuzhan'tar  In the coffer  however  Jacen confronts Onimi and then hears the voice of his late grandfather  Anakin Skywalker  telling him to stand firm  like he did on Duro  So as Jacen fights Onimi  he manages to achieve oneness with the Force  knowing that he'll never achieve this state again while simultaneously knowing that he'll spend the rest of his life trying to do so  As a result  Jacen defeats Supreme Overlord Onimi  Han  Leia  and Nom Anor arrive just in time to watch Jacen amazing victory as he appears to age five years  Onimi  meanwhile  is reverted of his Shamed deformities  but because his deformities were the result of his gaining the Force  he loses control of the toxins in his body and dies  melting into a puddle of foul hydrocarbons that is absorbed by the coffer yorik coral floor like a stain  The coffer begins to die off due its now lost connection with Onimi  and Nom Anor tries to trick the Solos into going into a garbage chute while he escapes alive  With his Vongsense  Jacen thwarts his plan  and when Nom Anor tries one more time to evade the Solos  his hand is cut off by Leia via her lightsaber  Nevertheless  Nom Anor opens up the entry into the coffer yorik trema (landing craft) and simply allows the Solos to leave without him; due to his atheism  which makes him undesirable in the Yuuzhan Vong society  and his contempt for the Force  which makes him undesirable in the Galactic Alliance society  Nom Anor elects to die aboard the coffer  despite his earlier vows of surviving the war  The coffer explosion is viewed by Warmaster Nas Choka and his fleet  He announces to all of his forces that the

750,Earthlight,The plot describes how political tension between the government of a politically united Earth (which maintains sovereignty over the Moon) and independent settlers and traders elsewhere in the solar system who have formed a federation  erupts into warfare over the terms for the availability to the Federation of scarce heavy metals  The trigger for hostilities is the publication of a research paper suggesting that the Moon may have previously unsuspected heavy metal resources which Earth proposes to monopolise  The Earth government intelligence agency suspects that confidential information concerning the exploitation of these mineral riches may be being leaked to the Federation and presses an accountant  Bertram Sadler  into service  Sadler is sent to the Moon main astronomical observatory located near the crater of Plato as a tip off has suggested that information is being routed through that location  Sadler cover story is that he is carrying out an investigation of waste in government spending  The rising political tension is accompanied by the observatory staff enjoying the good fortune of observing a nearby supernova explosion in the constellation of Draco  Despite a relatively long preceding era of peace  Earth and the Federation each prepare technologically for war  The Federation develops a new method of spacedrive propulsion while Earth develops new shielding technology and a weapon which uses an electromagnet propelled bayonet of liquid metal  (The weapon mistaken for a beam of light)  Such a weapon is currently being developed by DARPA  A climactic battle between three Federation cruisers and the fortified mining installation (Project Thor) is played out near Mount Pico close to the lunar observatory  Two astronomers who have delivered a top Earth scientist to Pico with only a couple of hours to spare  witness the battle  Sadler  whose investigations have had no pay off except for the unmasking of an embezzling store manager  relinquishes his cover by going to debrief the two astronomers  Of the three Federal cruisers  two are destroyed along with the mine in the battle  The third cruiser  named The Acheron  is terminally damaged and retreats towards Mars  but has little chance of reaching it before her nuclear reactor explodes  However  her new drive gives her the capability of a rendezvous with a passenger liner  The Pegasus  which is able to rescue all but one of the crew who have to make the 40 second crossing without space suits  This inconclusive duel between mother planet and formerly dependent colonists  with each side suffering stiffer resistance than anticipated  discredits the governments on both sides  Sadler is able to return to civilian life but suffers nagging frustration that he never found out whether the spy that he was searching for existed or not  Many years later the commander of the Acheron writes his memoirs and reveals that information had reached the Federation from One of Earth most distinguished astronomers  now living in honoured retirement on the Moon  With this hint  Sadler is able to confirm the spy identity as Robert Molton  the first one of the observatory staff to greet him on his way to the observatory  The novel concludes with Moulton enlightening Sadler and the reader as to the brilliant technical subterfuge with which he transmitted information  namely that he used the observatory main telescope as a transmitter by placing a modulated ultra violet source at its prime focus  The signal was received by a Federation spaceship a few million kilometers away ,1,0,0,0,0
751,A Fall of Moondust,By the 21st century  the Moon has been colonized  and although still very much a research establishment  it is visited by tourists who can afford the trip  One of its attractions is a cruise across one of the lunar seas  named the Sea of Thirst  (located within the Sinus Roris) filled with an extremely fine dust  a fine powder far drier than the contents of a terrestrial desert and which almost flows like water  instead of the common regolith which covers most of the lunar surface  A specially designed boat named the Selene skims over the surface of the dust in the same manner as a jetski  But on one cruise  a moonquake causes an underground cavern to collapse  upsetting the equilibrium  As the dustcruiser Selene passes over  it sinks about 15 meters below the surface of the dust  hiding the vessel from view  and trapping it beneath the dust  Immediately there are potentially fatal problems for the crew and passengers inside  The sunken Selene has a limited air supply  there is no way for heat generated to escape  communications are impossible  and no one else is sure where Selene has been lost  As precious time begins to run out and the Selene heats up and the air becomes unbreathable  young Captain Pat Harris and his chief stewardess Sue Wilkins try to keep the passengers occupied and psychologically stable while waiting to be rescued  They are helped by a retired space ship captain and explorer  Commodore Hansteen  who is initially traveling incognito  Chief Engineer (Earthside) Robert Lawrence is skeptical that a rescue can be mounted  even if the Selene can be located  He is ready to abandon an initially unsuccessful search  when he is contacted by Thomas Lawson  a brilliant but eccentric astronomer who  from his vantage point on a satellite high above the Moon  Lagrange 2  believes he has detected the remains of a heat trail on the surface  An expedition is organized and Lawrence indeed makes contact with the Selene  However the completely alien environment results in numerous unforeseen complications  The rescue mission decides to sink a tube supplying oxygen to the Selene first  in an effort to buy time to think of a way to get the passengers out  However  this becomes a race against the clock  as the heat in the Selene knocks out the chemical air purification system and the passengers are suffering from CO2 poisoning  To preserve air  most passengers enter a chemically induced sleep  with only Pat Harris and physicist Duncan McKenzie staying awake  Just in time  the rescuers manage to drill a hole in the roof and sink the air supply  A plan is hatched to save the passengers of the Selene by sinking several concrete caissons to the roof of the ship and cutting a hole  When the first caisson is sunk  disaster strikes again: the liquid wastage of the passengers had been expelled out of the ship  turning the dust around it into mud  which causes another  smaller  cave in  The Selene sinks once more  this time only a small distance  but crucially  at a slope  This means the caissons cannot be connected anymore to the sloping roof  Also air supply and communications have been damaged  After restoring these latter two  a new plan is made to sink the caissons  but now the bottom one has a flexible tube attached to it which can be mounted to the sloping roof of the Selene  The rescue mission works according to plan: the caissons are sunk  the dust is scooped out and the connection is made  but now time is running out again  When the air supply holes were drilled  Selenes double hull was breached and the space in between slowly filled with dust  The metal rich dust reached the battery packs and short circuited them  This causes the inner hull to be burning slowly  The resulting breach is barricaded by the passengers  but dust is still pouring in and there is a fear that the burning material will cause the liquid oxygen supply to explode  Meanwhile  Robert Lawrence is working in the rescue shaft: he sets a small ring charge to make a hole in the roof  Just in time  the hole is made and the passengers escape through the shaft  Captain Harris is the last to leave  up to his waist in dust  Just when he is clear of the shaft  the liquid oxygen explodes  destroying the Selene  A short epilogue sees Lawrence writing his memoirs  Pat and Sue married  and Pat hoping to transfer to the space service ,1,0,0,0,0

753,The Ersatz Elevator,The Baudelaire children walk with Mr  Poe to their new home on 667 Dark Avenue  The street is dark  as light is out or unpopular  The elevators in the apartment building are not working  as elevators are out leaving the Baudelaires to walk up the 66 flights of stairs to the penthouse where the Squalors live  Jerome Squalor welcomes the children to their new home  He offers them aqueous martinis  (water garnished with an olive served in a fancy glass)  and introduces them to his wife Esm√© Squalor  the city sixth most important financial adviser  who is concerned about what is in and what is out  Jerome avoids disputes with Esm√©  as he hates arguing with her  and follows her instructions  Esm√© sends the children and Jerome to Caf√© Salmonella for dinner  because she will be busy privately discussing arrangements for an auction with trendy auctioneer Gunther  The Baudelaires recognize Gunther as Count Olaf  despite his attempt to disguise his eyebrow with a monocle and high boots to cover up the tattoo of an eye on his ankle  Despite their protestations  Jerome takes the children to the restaurant  Jerome believes the children are being xenophobic and dismisses their suspicions of Gunther  Klaus notices that there is one elevator door on each floor except for the top floor which has two  The children discover that the extra elevator is a fake  ersatz and consists of nothing but an empty shaft  They climb down the shaft  to find the two Quagmire triplets trapped in a cage at the bottom of the shaft  The Quagmires say that Count Olaf is planning to smuggle them out of the city by hiding them as an object at the In auction  which one of his associates will bid on  The Baudelaires return to the penthouse to find tools with which they can free the Quagmires  but they return to find that Gunther has cast the Quagmires away already  They return  dispirited  to the penthouse  Klaus finds a Lot #50  V F D   in the auction catalog  Esm√© pretends to believe the children story about Gunther plot to kidnap the Quagmires  but when they show her the ersatz elevator  she pushes them down the empty shaft  They land halfway down in a net  Sunny climbs up the shaft with her razor sharp teeth  gets their ersatz rope and jumps back down into the net  Sunny bites a hole in the net  and using the rope they climb down from the net and travel along the hallway at the bottom of the shaft  with Violet ersatz welding torches  only to find that it is a dead end  Pounding on the ceiling reveals that it is in fact a trap door; the children escape through it only to find themselves in the charred remains of the Baudelaire Mansion  They rush to Veblen Hall  the location of the auction  and join the crowd already there  The auction has begun  and Gunther and Esm√© are on the stage auctioning off Lot #46  The children ask Jerome to buy them Lot #50  Mr  Poe and Jerome back down but Sunny bids on it and wins  The Baudelaires open the box  only to reveal Very Fancy Doilies  Gunther slips on the doilies and is revealed as Count Olaf when his boots and monocle fly off  revealing his eyebrow and tattoo  Count Olaf and Esm√© flee  pursued by the audience  The doorman is revealed as The Hook Handed Man  and the Quagmires are hidden in the red herring statue  Although Jerome wants to keep the Baudelaires  he insists on taking them far away  They refuse this  however  because they want to rescue the Quagmires  The story ends when Jerome is forced to give them up  because he is too cowardly to help them  Mr  Poe is calling a Vietnamese restaurant instead of the police and the three children sit on the stairs of the hall ,0,1,0,0,0
754,The Vile Village,The book begins when the Baudelaires are in Mr  Poe office  looking at The Daily Punctilio (a poorly written newspaper full of lies about the Quagmires and Count Olaf)  Mr  Poe gives a brochure to the Baudelaire orphans about a new program allowing an entire village to serve as guardian  based on the saying It takes a village to raise a child   The children naturally choose V F D   an acronym which the two Quagmire triplets (before they were captured by Count Olaf)  discovered is part of a fearsome secret somehow related to Count Olaf  The children depart for the unknown V F D  by bus  and after a long  hot and dusty walk from the bus stop  they reach the town of V F D   which is filled with crows  They become acquainted with the Council of Elders  who proclaim that the children will do all the chores for the entire village  but they will be living with Hector  the handyman  Hector takes them to his home  where he shows them the house  the barn and the Nevermore Tree  where all the crows come to roost at night  The Baudelaires learn that V F D  stands for the Village of Fowl Devotees  Hector shows the Baudelaires the following couplet  which he says was found at the base of Nevermore Tree: For sapphires we are held in here  Only you can end our fear  The Baudelaires discover that Hector has been breaking the town rules by keeping a secret library and working on a hot air mobile home in his barn  so that he can sail away from V F D  forever  They discuss the Quagmires and consider the fact that Isadora might be somehow sending the Baudelaires a plea for help in the poem  They also discover a new couplet under the tree  though they've kept the tree under surveillance the whole night  which reads: Until dawn comes we cannot speak  No words can come from this sad beak  Two members of the Council of Elders come and report that Count Olaf has been captured  and the Baudelaires are to report immediately to the Town Hall  The Baudelaires discover that Count Olaf was not captured  but instead a man named Jacques  who also has one eyebrow and a tattoo of an eye on his ankle  The children insist that he is not Count Olaf  but the townspeople do not listen to them  The next day he is to be burned at the stake  That night the Baudelaires construct a plan  Sunny keeps watch at Nevermore Tree to see where the poems are coming from  Klaus searches the rules of V F D  for something to help Jacques out of trouble  Violet helps finish Hector hot air balloon device  for it will be a useful escape device if Count Olaf comes after them  Violet fixes the hot air balloon  Klaus discovers that a rule allows the accused to make a speech explaining himself  If a few people say something  mob psychology can make everyone demand the same thing and thus they can suggest that Jacques be freed  Sunny discovers that the crows are somehow delivering the couplets  and finds a new one: The first thing you read contains the clue  An initial way to speak to you  When the children run to the uptown jail where Jacques is being held  they learn that he is dead  Officer Luciana announces that Jacques has been murdered in the night  and Olaf  masquerading as Detective Dupin  accuses the Baudelaires of murdering Count Olaf  He claims that Violet hair ribbon and a lens from Klaus glasses were found on the scene  and Sunny teeth marks are on the body  The people ignore the fact that the orphans have solid alibis and the children are quickly locked up inside the Deluxe Cell in the prison  prior to being burnt at the stake the following day for breaking the town rules  Detective Dupin tells them that one of them will make a great escape before the burning  making it possible for him to inherit the Baudelaire fortune  and he leaves them to decide who will survive  While they are locked up  Klaus realizes that it is his 13th birthday  Officer Luciana comes in and brings them water and bread  and Violet uses the bread and water to allow them to escape  By pouring the pitcher of water repeatedly down a wooden bench onto the wall to soften the mortar  and then squeezing the water out of the bread where it had collected at the bottom of the wall  This process  repeated all through the day  evening and following morning slowly starts to yield results by weakening the thick brick walls of the prison cell  At daybreak  Hector comes to the window and tells them that if they manage to break out  he has the hot air balloon ready  He also gives them the daily couplet: Inside these letters the eye will see  Nearby are your friends and V F D  Running out of time  they break free of the jail using the wooden bench as a battering ram against the weakened mortar and read the poems all together  using the clue An initial way to speak to you  to read the first initial of each line  ::For sapphires we are held in here  ::Only you can end our fear  ::Until dawn comes we cannot speak  ::No words can come from this sad beak  ::The first thing you read contains the clue  ::An initial way to speak to you  ::Inside these letters the eye will see  ::Nearby are your friends and V F D  The Baudelaires figure out a number of things: The sapphires refer to the Quagmires' fortune  The Quagmires cannot speak until dawn as the crows do not arrive uptown until then  The initial way to speak to them is not V F D   but the first letter in each verse  which spells out 'fountain'  They rush over to Fowl Fountain where Sunny manages to press a secret button in the eye of the crow  which opens the beak  revealing the damp Quagmires inside  At this point they flee the mob coming to burn them  and make a run for the outskirts of town  As they go  the Quagmires explain that Count Olaf locked them in the tower of his house  Then he had his associates build the fountain and imprisoned the Quagmires  The Quagmires attached the couplet to the crows' feet every morning  which fell off in the Nevermore Tree when the paper was dry  They tell the Baudelaires that the man who died was Jacques Snicket  but the mob catches sight of them and they have to run  They reach the outskirts of town and Hector arrives in his hot air mobile home  He throws down a rope ladder and the Quagmires start to climb up to get inside  Officer Luciana shoots at the rope ladder with a harpoon gun  breaking the rope whilst the Baudelaires are still climbing and preventing them from continuing   they jump down to earth  saying good bye to the Quagmires  who then throw their notebooks down to the orphans so they can read their research  A final harpoon pierces the books and scatters them  as the hot air mobile home heads towards the horizon  The book ends with Count Olaf and Officer Luciana  who is revealed to be Esme Squalor  escaping on a motorcycle  and the Baudelaires fleeing  rather than waiting for the police  as the Daily Punctilio has written an article that they killed Jacques ,0,1,0,0,0

976,Not Applicable,Our previous results on the connection between the Forbush decreases (FD) of cosmic ray intensity and the deviations from the expected values of the diurnal temperature range (DTR) are briefly revisited  The same type of analysis is then extended to the cases of sudden increases of cosmic ray intensity (GLE)  as well as to the search for lattitude effects in the observed correlations  We find that all the investigated correlations appear to manifest both the expected signs and the plausible phase relations  though each one only at the modest confidence level  Moreover  it appears that there is some proportionality between the magnitude of a cosmic ray intensity change and a corresponding DTR deviation  both in the case of FD and GLE events  Eventual increase of the confidence levels at which these correlations are established would have to wait for the significant increase of the number of well defined and sufficiently intense recorded departures of cosmic ray intensity from its stationary mean value  On the other hand  the probability of such an accidental multiple coincidence of independent pieces of evidence is certainly very low ,0,0,0,1,0

990,Not Applicable,Knowledge Representation and Reasoning and Machine Learning are two important fields in AI  Nonmonotonic logic programming (NMLP) and Answer Set Programming (ASP) provide formal languages for representing and reasoning with commonsense knowledge and realize declarative problem solving in AI  On the other side  Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) realizes Machine Learning in logic programming  which provides a formal background to inductive learning and the techniques have been applied to the fields of relational learning and data mining  Generally speaking  NMLP and ASP realize nonmonotonic reasoning while lack the ability of learning  By contrast  ILP realizes inductive learning while most techniques have been developed under the classical monotonic logic  With this background  some researchers attempt to combine techniques in the context of nonmonotonic ILP  Such combination will introduce a learning mechanism to programs and would exploit new applications on the NMLP side  while on the ILP side it will extend the representation language and enable us to use existing solvers  Cross fertilization between learning and nonmonotonic reasoning can also occur in such as the use of answer set solvers for ILP  speed up learning while running answer set solvers  learning action theories  learning transition rules in dynamical systems  abductive learning  learning biological networks with inhibition  and applications involving default and negation  This workshop is the first attempt to provide an open forum for the identification of problems and discussion of possible collaborations among researchers with complementary expertise  The workshop was held on September 15th of 2013 in Corunna  Spain  This post proceedings contains five technical papers (out of six accepted papers) and the abstract of the invited talk by Luc De Raedt ,0,0,0,1,0
